* Preface
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: front-matter-title
  :END:

As I wrote in the preface to the first edition, this book was originally
triggered by a range of questions I had been asked over the years. They
were questions about information, representation, digitization and
management. The more I quoted standard answers from standard literature,
the more restless I became because I perceived a lack of coherence in my
answers. There seemed to be too many holes and grey areas, and, rather
more worryingly, too few connections between the various parts of the
underlying body of knowledge.

This led to a number of other, more fundamental questions I had to ask
myself before attempting to answer the ones I was being asked. I tried
to peel off one by one the multiple layers of the phenomena that
intrigued me, without losing sight of the whole. Thankfully, I was able
to find enough enlightenment in literature. There have been quite a few
clever people who attacked the same questions before me and managed to
come up with convincing answers. My own contribution lies primarily in
the interpretation of their theories and the connections I suggest
between them and with the domain of buildings.

Note that in contrast to earlier publications of mine, I talk about
buildings rather than architecture. The reason for doing so is that
buildings and built environments have a larger scope than architecture,
as suggested by the relation between the Dutch terms ‘bouwkunde' and
‘architectuur': the latter is a specialization within the former. It is
unfortunate that both are translated into English as ‘architecture' (the
less said about terms like ‘building science' the better).

This second edition was motivated by a few new questions that emerged
after I started using the textbook in my course. One thing a teacher
quickly learns is that working with a textbook is like opening a can of
worms: practically every subject the textbook touches upon calls for
more attention, for further explanations and for space in the book.
Resisting this call is not always possible but, at the same time,
expanding the scope of a textbook can be exhausting to its authors and
confusing to its readers. So, it has to be kept within a pragmatic size,
determined by the authors' expertise and the length of the courses it
serves. Within these constraints, the textbook must be allowed to grow
organically towards a fuller picture of its subjects and their context.

I am grateful to the people who formulated the theories discussed in
this book. I have learned a lot from them. More directly, I was assisted
by a number of people who deserve my profound thanks: Saskia Roselaar
for her thorough proofreading of the first edition; Monique de Bont for
the meticulous copyright control and Jacqueline Michielen-van de Riet
and Michiel de Jong for managing the production process of both
editions. Polyxeni Mantzou, Paul Chan and Thanos Economou reviewed the
first edition. I am indebted to them all for their time and constructive
criticism.

I am also thankful to the students who took my course for their many
insightful questions and remarks. The first edition was used in 2019 in
the Information Management course of the MBE master track at the Faculty
of Architecture & the Built Environment (Faculteit Bouwkunde, in Dutch),
Delft University of Technology, and then in 2020 and 2021 in the online
versions of the course under COVID-19 lockdown. I hope we will not have
to continue teaching online in 2022, even though the textbook was of
great help when this was the only option. Given the educational
limitations of online lectures and workshops, I was greatly consoled by
the thought that students had the opportunity to use the textbook in
order to cover what we might have missed in our live sessions.

* Introduction
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: front-matter-title
  :END:

This is the second, improved edition of a book about the foundations and
principles of building information, its representation and management.
In contrast to other books on the same subjects, it is not a how-to
guide. It does not tell you which software or policies to choose for
representing buildings and managing the resulting information. Instead,
the book argues that one should not start with these practical steps
before fully understanding the reasoning behind any such choice. This
includes the structure of information and of the representations that
contain it, the purposes of managing information in these
representations and the situations in which the representations are
used. In a nutshell: how information relates to the cognitive and social
processes of a specific domain. Without adequate reasoning that covers
all syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects, adopting this software or
that and implementing this policy or that simply subjugate information
processing to some prescriptive or proscriptive framework that may be
unproductive or inappropriate for the domain and its professionals.

To explain these foundations and principles, the book brings together
knowledge from various areas, including philosophy and computer science.
Its perspective, nevertheless, remains bounded by the application
domain: external knowledge is not imposed on domain practices but used
to elucidate domain knowledge. Building information has its own
peculiarities, drawn more from convention than necessity, and
digitization has yet to address such matters, let alone resolve them.
General knowledge about information and representation is essential for
developing approaches fit for the digital era. The approach advocated in
this book is above all parsimonious: in a world inundated with digital
information (Part I), one should not resort to brute force and store or
process everything. On the contrary, one should organize information
intelligently, so that everything remains accessible but with less and
more focused effort.

The first part of the book focuses on digitization as the opportunity
and reason for paying even more attention to information than in
previous eras, when many of the tools and approaches we still use today
were formulated. This part was produced by splitting a single chapter in
the first edition into two: Chapter 1 deals with digital information in
general, while Chapter 2 focuses on digitization in AECO. The split
hopefully makes clearer what has been happening in the domain of
buildings while the digital revolution took place and why AECO needs to
do more than just use available computing resources. 

The second part explains representation. Many of the problems
surrounding information and its management are caused when we ignore
that most information, certainly regarding buildings, comes organized
into representations. Knowing the structure of these representations
provides connections to meaning and use, as well as insights into how
information is produced and processed. Chapter 3 explains symbolic
representations and analyses familiar spatial representations from a
symbolic perspective. The analogue representations that still dominate
building information are the subject of Chapter 4. Digitization is
primarily considered with respect to BIM, as the first generation of
truly symbolic, digital building representations (Chapter 5).

Information theory and management are the subjects of the third part of
the book. Particular emphasis is on the meaning of information
(semantics) as a foundation for utility and relevance. For this reason,
this part starts by introducing a semantic theory of information that
complements symbolic representation (Chapter 6). Next, Chapter 7
explains information management and how it applies to building
information and BIM. It concludes with the principles that should guide
building information management.

The fourth part of the book contains the most important changes from the
first edition. Chapter 8 is completely new. It provides a summary of the
influential dual-process theory of the mind, which has particular
significance for decision making and the use of information in it. The
next two chapters were produced by splitting a chapter of the first
edition because some things I had originally considered a simple
preliminary to developing information diagrams turned out to be a main
learning objective for my students. Chapter 9 now deals more extensively
with process diagrams, their structure and purpose, including in
relation to cognitive biases and limitations. Chapter 10 covers the move
from process to information diagrams, the validation of process designs,
meaningful information management and support for Type 2 thinking.

Having explained the foundations and principles of representation and
information management, the book rounds the subject off with a few
larger exercises, which can be used as individual or group assignments
(Part V). Through these exercises, learners can test their understanding
of the approach advocated in this book and hone their skills for its
application in research or practice.

Also new are the appendices. The first collects the necessary knowledge
on graph theory in a compact overview and the second explains what
parameterization actually does. Both are helpful for understanding
critical parts of the book.

Information has always been important to us. There are even theories in
ecological psychology that propose that information relevant to our
interaction with an environment is perceived directly, without first
interpreting sensory input into a description of the environment. Still,
we are right in calling the current period the information age because
of the impact of digital information technologies. Therefore, the
starting point in our exploration of building information and
information management is the reciprocal relation between information
and digitization. This grand theme of our times takes a peculiar form in
AECO --- a form that in several respects conflicts with general
tendencies.

* Digital information
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/The book starts with some key characteristics of the information age:
how the digital revolution changed not only the amount of stored
information but also attitudes toward information. Global, ubiquitous
infrastructures allow for unprecedented access to information and
processing power. This promotes new standards of behaviour and
performance in societies and economies that are increasingly
information-based. /

* Information explosion
We are all familiar with how significant storage capacity is: we
routinely buy smartphones with gigabytes of memory and hard drives with
capacities of a couple of terabytes. The availability and affordability
of such devices, and even the familiarity with these data units are a
far cry from not so long ago. In the last decades of the previous
century, personal computers were a new phenomenon, digital photography
was in its infancy and today's social media did not even exist yet. In
1983, the Apple Lisa, the commercially failed precursor to the
Macintosh, had a five megabyte hard disk and cost almost US $ 10,0000
(the equivalent of over US $ 25,000 today). In 1988, a FUJIX DS-1P, the
first fully digital camera, had a two megabyte memory card that could
hold five to ten photographs. Our need for data storage and
communication has changed a lot since those heady times.

The obvious reason for this change is the explosive increase in
information production that characterizes the digital era. In a process
of steady growth through the centuries, human societies had previously
accumulated an estimated 12 exabytes of information. By 1944 libraries
were doubling in size every 16 years, provided there was physical space
for expansion. Space limitations were removed by the rise of home
computers and the invention of the Internet. These allowed annual
information growth rates of 30% that raised the total to 180 exabytes by
2006 and to over 1.8 zettabytes by 2011. More recently, the total more
than doubled every two years, reaching 18 zettabytes in 2018 and 44
zettabytes in 2020, and expected to become 175 zettabytes by 2025.

The Internet is full of such astounding calculations and dramatic
projections,[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-1][^{[1]}]]
which never fail to warn that the total may become even higher, as the
population of information users and producers keeps increasing, as well
as expanding to cover devices generating and sharing data on the IoT.
But even if we ever reach a plateau, as with Moore's “law” with respect
to computing
capacity,[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-2][^{[2]}]]
we already have an enormous problem in our hands: a huge amount of data
to manage. 1.2 exabytes are stored only by the big four (Google,
Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook), while other big providers like Dropbox,
Barracuda and SugarSync, and less accessible servers in industry and
academia probably hold similar
amounts.[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-3][^{[3]}]]

What makes these numbers even more important is that information is not
just stored but, above all, intensively and extensively processed.
Already in 2008, Google processed 20 petabytes a
day.[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-4][^{[4]}]] In
many respects, it is less interesting how much data we produce on a
daily or annual basis than what we do with these data. Not surprisingly,
social media and mobile phones dominate in any account of digital data
processing: in 2018, people sent 473,400 tweets, shared 2 million photos
on Snapchat and posted 49,380 pictures on Instagram. Google handled 3.5
billion searches a day, while 1.5 billion people (one-fifth of the
world's population) were active on Facebook every day.

In 2020, the picture slightly changed as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic: we produced 1.7 MB of data per person per second, with a large
share again going into social media, while communication platforms like
Zoom and Microsoft Teams, as well online shopping and food ordering,
attracted significantly more
activity.[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-5][^{[5]}]]
Anything good or bad happening in the world only increases our
dependence on the information and communication possibilities of the
Internet, especially now that so many of us can afford utilizing them
anytime and anyplace on their smartphones. Consequently, safeguarding
information quality, veracity, accessibility and flow already forms a
major challenge for both producers and consumers of data.

The situation is further complicated by changing attitudes toward
information. Not so long ago, most people were afraid of information
overload.[[#chapter-001-digital-information.xhtml#footnote-116-6][^{[6]}]]
Nowadays we have moved to a diametrically different point of view and
are quite excited about the potential of big data and related AI
approaches. From being a worry, the plethora of information we produce
and consume has become an opportunity. At the same time, we are
increasingly concerned with data protection and privacy, as amply
illustrated by the extent and severity of laws like the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union
([[https://gdpr.eu]]). Attitudes may change further, moreover in
unpredictable ways, as suggested by reactions to the Facebook--Cambridge
Analytica data breach in 2018 and worries about data collection in
relation to COVID-19.

* Information and digitization
It is not accidental that we talk about our era as both the information
age and the digital revolution --- two characterizations that (not
coincidentally) appeared in quick succession. The rapid growth of
information production and dissemination, the changes in human
behaviours and societal standards or the shift from industrial
production to information-based economies would not have been possible
without digital technologies. Before the digital revolution, there were
technologies for recording and transmitting information but they were
not capable of processing information or available to practically all.
The information age demands digital technologies, which are consequently
present in almost every aspect of daily life, making information
processing synonymous with digital devices, from wearables to the cloud.
This also means that there is increasingly less that we do with
alternative means (e.g. order food by phone rather than through an app),
especially since a lot of information is no longer available on analogue
media. For example, most encyclopaedias and reference works that used to
adorn the bookshelves of homes in the second half of the twentieth
century are either no longer available on paper or cannot compete with
online sources for actuality, detail and multimedia content. Online
video, audio and image sharing platforms have similarly resulted in
unprecedented collections that include many digitized analogue media.
Despite the frequently low resolution and overall quality of transcribed
media, there is no practical alternative to the wealth and accessibility
of these platforms.

Related to the dominance of these platforms is that most data
transactions take place within specific channels and apps. Nobody
publishes on social media in general but specifically on Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok or whatever happens to be popular
with the intended audience at the time. Even though overarching search
engines can access most of these data, production, storage and
communication are restricted by the often proprietary structure of the
hosting environments. As a result, digital information tends to be more
fragmented than many assume. Leaving aside the thorny issues of data
ownership, protection, rights and privacy, the technical and
organizational problems resulting from such restrictions and
fragmentation may be beyond the capacities of an individual or even a
small firm. Being so dependent on specific digital means for our
information needs makes us vulnerable in more respects than we probably
imagine and adds to the complexity of information management. It also
suggests that privacy is totally lost, as data about user actions and
communications are collected by tech companies, whose digital products
and services we keep on using because of some huge generic advantages,
such as the immense extent and power of crowdsourcing on the Internet.

Regardless of such problems, however, it is inevitable that the means of
information production, dissemination and management will remain
primarily digital, with growing amounts of information available to us
and often necessary for our endeavours. Digitization creates new
opportunities for our information needs but, on the other hand, also
adds to the problems that must be resolved and their complexity.
Digitization is so widely diffuse and pervasive that we are already in a
hybrid reality, where the Internet and other digital technologies form
permanent layers that mediate even in mundane, everyday activities, such
as answering a doorbell. In a growing number of areas, the digital
layers are becoming dominant: social media are a primary area for
politics, while health and activity are increasingly dependent on
self-tracking data and economies are to a large extent about intangible
data. Consequently, safety and security in cyberspace are at least as
important as in reality. Moreover, they call for dynamic, adaptable
solutions that match the fluidity and extent of a digital information
infrastructure. It follows that, rather than putting our faith in
currently dominant techniques, we need to understand the principles on
which solution should be based and devise better approaches for the
further development of information infrastructures.

Interestingly, these infrastructures are not always about us. One aspect
of the digital complexity that should not be ignored is that a lot of
machine-produced data (and hence a lot of computational power) goes into
machine-to-machine communication and human-computer interaction, e.g.
between different systems in a car (from anti-lock braking systems and
touch-activated locks to entertainment and navigation systems) or in the
interpretation of user actions on a tablet (distinguishing between
pushing a button, selecting a virtual brush, drawing a line with the
brush or translating finger pressure into stroke width). Such data, even
though essential for the operations of information processing, are
largely invisible to the end user and hence easy to ignore if one
focuses primarily on the products rather than the whole chain of
technologies involved in a task. On the other hand, these chains and the
data they produce and consume are a major part of any innovation in
digital technologies and their applications: we have already moved on
from information-related development to development dependent on
digitization.

* Effects of digital information
The practical effects of digital information technologies are widely
known, frequently experienced and eagerly publicized. Digitization is
present in all aspects of daily life, improving access and efficiency
but also causing worries for lost skills, invasion of privacy and
effects on the environment. With apps replacing even shopping lists,
handwriting is practiced less and less, and handwritten text is becoming
more and more illegible. Communication with friends, colleagues, banks,
authorities etc. is predominantly Internet-based but cannot fully
replace physical proximity and contact, as we have seen in the COVID-19
pandemic. Electricity demand keeps rising, both at home or work and for
the necessary infrastructure, such as data centres.

Other, equally significant effects, are less frequently discussed,
arguably because they go much deeper and affect us so fundamentally that
we fail to recognize the changes. For example, with the easy
availability and wide accessibility of information, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to claim ignorance of anything --- much harder
than it has been since the newspaper and news agency boom in the second
half of the nineteenth century, and the radio and television
broadcasting that followed. More and more facts, events and opinions are
becoming common knowledge, from what happens today all over the world to
new interpretations of the past, including absurd complot theories. As
patients, citizens, students, tourists or hobbyists we can no longer
afford to miss anything that seems relevant to our situations or
activities.

Another cardinal effect is that we are no longer the centre of the
information world, the sole or ultimate possessor and processor of
information. Our environment has been transformed and enriched with
machine-based capacities that rival and sometimes surpass our own, so
changing our relation to our environment, too. Interestingly, our
reactions to this loss of exclusivity are variable and even ambivalent.
On one hand, we worry about the influence of hidden algorithms and AI,
and on the other, we are jubilant about the possibilities of
human-machine collaboration. Dystopian and utopian scenarios abound,
while we become more and more dependent on information-processing
machines. One of the key messages of this book is that, regardless of
hopes and fears, there are principles on which we can base our symbiosis
with these machines: tasks we can safely delegate to computers and
support we can expect from them in order to improve our own information
processing and decision making.

Finally, the most profound and arguably lasting effect of digitization
is that it invites us to interpret and even experience the world as
information, understanding practically everything in terms of entities,
properties, relations and processes. Our metaphors for the world were
always influenced by the structure of our artefacts: the things we had
designed and therefore knew intimately. Projecting their functioning and
principles to other things we have been trying to comprehend, like the
cosmos, made sense and enabled us to develop new knowledge and
technologies. Current conceptual models of reality are heavily
influenced by digital information and the machines that store and
process it. Human memory processes are explained analogically to hard
drive operations and our visual perception is understood by reference to
digital image capture and recognition. Such conceptual models are a
mixed blessing. As explanations of the mind or social patterns they can
be reductionist and mechanistic but at the same time they can be useful
as bridges to processing related information with computers.

* Information management
All the above makes information management (IM) a task that is not
exclusive to managers and computer specialists. It involves everyone who
disseminates, receives or stores information. Very few people are
concerned with IM just for the sake of it. Most approach information and
its management in the framework of their own activities, for which
information is an essential commodity. This makes IM not an alien,
externally imposed obligation but a key aspect of everyone's activities,
a fundamental element in communication and collaboration, and a joint
responsibility for all --- a necessity for anyone who relies on
information for their functioning or livelihood.

Given the complexity of our hybrid reality and the lack of transparency
in many of our approaches to it, this book bypasses technical solutions
and focuses on the conceptual and operational structure of IM: the
principles for developing clear and effective approaches. These
approaches can lead to better information performance, including through
reliable criteria for selecting and evaluating means used for their
implementation. In other words, we need a clear understanding of what we
have to do and why before deciding on how (which techniques are fitting
for our goals and constraints).

The proposed principles include definitions of information and
representation, and operational structures for connecting process
management to IM. IM therefore becomes a matter not of brute force (by
computers or humans) but of organization and relevance. One can store
all documents and hope for the best but stored information is not
necessarily accessible or usable. As we know from searches on the
Internet, search machines can be very clever in retrieving what there is
out there but this does not necessarily mean that they return the
answers we need. If one asks for the specific causes of a fault in a
building, it is not enough to receive all documents on the building to
browse and interpret. Identifying all information that refers precisely
to the relevant parts or aspects of the building depends on how archives
and documents have been organized and maintained. To achieve that, we
cannot rely on exhaustive, labour-intensive interpretation, indexing and
cross-referencing of each part of each document. Instead, we should try
to understand the nature and structure of the information these
documents contain and then build better representations and management
strategies, which not only improve IM but also connect it better to our
processes and the tasks they comprise.

* Digitization in AECO
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/This chapter presents the background of AECO digitization, starting
with general tendencies and moving on to particular developments in
AECO, including BIM. It explains these developments from a historical
perspective and outlines the limitations they cause to further
digitization and decision making in AECO. /

* Private versus business
While in our private lives we are quite digitally minded and data savvy,
there is little to suggest that digitization similarly dominates
professional activities in AECO. Despite the enthusiastic reception of
technological developments, such as 3D printing, digitization has yet to
reach a substantial depth or breadth in AECO. We use computer programs
like BIM and CAD to draw or spreadsheets to calculate but reality in
AECO remains analogue, dominated by information carriers like drawings
and other conventional documents on paper: remnants of an era when we
did not have the same information processing capacities as today. This
is unlike e.g. the music industry, where vinyl, CD and other carriers
are just a matter of nostalgia, while the content has become fully
digital, or online on-demand services like Netflix or Spotify, which
have moreover changed digital attitudes in spectacular ways, practically
eliminating music and video piracy.

The probable reason is that AECO generally remains attached to analogue,
largely pre-industrial processes that require little if any mediation
from digital technologies --- much like fishing and hunting, two other
industries with a low investment in digitization. These processes cause
legacy information solutions, such as paper-based documents, to persist,
severely limiting the potential and nature of digitization. Resisting or
even ejecting digitization is, of course, justified if there is no
reason for it. Regrettably, this is not the case with AECO, given its
far from satisfactory performance. It follows that the high contrast
with other industries or even private life calls for a closer
investigation of the particular circumstances of AECO, towards a clearer
identification of underlying causes and resulting problems.

* Digital uptake
There is broad consensus that AECO is one of the least digitized
sectors.[[#chapter-002-digitization-in-aeco.xhtml#footnote-118-1][^{[1]}]]
Everyone seems to be in agreement: on the Internet, in professional and
academic publications, in software advertisements. A critical note is
that the claim is based on few data, chiefly proxies, and a lot of
opinions of people in AECO or digitization, i.e. with vested interests
in the deployment of new technologies. Still, the slow digital uptake in
AECO seems so plausible that it is widely used as justification for
various digital solutions: manifestos by policy makers, standards by
professional bodies, new approaches by academic researchers, new
software by commercial developers. So, from a vague problem, we jump
directly to specific solutions, such as BIM, digital twins, Industry 4.0
etc.: panaceas for all the ills of AECO. The promise of the solutions is
invariably deemed so high that the resulting changes in AECO do not just
solve the problem; they make it disappear completely.

This poses an interesting conundrum: if the solutions are so readily
available and so powerful, there must be at least a significant minority
in AECO that adopts them and benefits from observable and convincing
improvements in performance. In turn, this should stimulate wider
adoption of the solutions in AECO and general advances. In short, things
should develop rapidly and smoothly, changing practices and behaviours,
as we can see with most digital technologies, from email to satellite
navigation. This, however, does not seem to be the case with
digitization in AECO. Even CAD and BIM have always been considered
primarily with respect to costs and obstacles. This suggests that most
of these solutions have little overall effect on the problems of AECO or
that they fail to fully utilize the potential of digitization.

The viewpoint advocated in this book is that most solutions do hold some
promise for solving real problems in AECO. However, instead of jumping
ahead and imposing any solution willy-nilly, we need first to understand
the relation between problems and solutions: describe and explain it, so
that we can judge if a solution is suitable and feasible. This calls for
a closer, more detailed inspection of digitization in AECO and its
background, which reveals that more than from slow uptake, digitization
in AECO suffers from having a secondary role. Even if investment is low
in comparison to other sectors, digitization is clearly present in AECO:
drawings are already made with CAD or, increasingly, BIM, while office
automation is complete and there are enough crossovers between the two,
such as invoicing software that draws data from CAD or BIM. In fact,
between 1997 and 2015 investment in digitization among German AECO
enterprises more than doubled.

Presence, however, is not enough because digitization remains too far in
the background of AECO decision and production processes. Digital
technologies are mostly found at the office, where they used to produce
conventional analogue documents, for use in outdated decision processes
and arguably more significantly in largely manual production processes:
building construction still relies more on cheap labour than on digital
means, such as productive robotization. AECO appears to have limited
investment to basic digitization, such as CAD and electronic invoicing.
More advanced and domain-specific technologies, from 3D scanning to
robotics, are rare, despite their acknowledged potential for
competitiveness, innovation and productivity. The reason for that may be
that there is little incentive in advanced technologies that are
unrelated or conflicting with current practices: why invest in
3D-scanning precision if the tolerances in building construction remain
high? This affects even basic digitization, such as CAD and BIM: why
invest in well-structured, precise models if the sole purpose of the
software is to produce drawings on paper? It is enough that these
drawings look correct.

* INFORMATION EXPLOSION IN AECO
Despite the slow, limited uptake of digital technologies, there is ample
evidence of the explosive growth of digital information in AECO. On one
end of the spectrum, we have new information sources that produce big
data, such as smartphones and sensors. These tell us a lot about users
and conditions in the built environment, and so promise a huge potential
for the analysis and improvement of building performance, but also
require substantial investment in technologies and organization.
Predictably, there is limited interest for this end, despite the appeal
of subjects like prop-tech and smart buildings.

At the other end of the spectrum, we encounter general-purpose
technologies (basic digitization) that have already become commonplace
and ubiquitous, hence also in AECO. Office automation has taken over the
production and dissemination of memos, reports, calculations and
presentations. Email, for instance, dominates communication and
information exchange by offering a digital equivalent to analogue
practices like letter writing. A main characteristic of these
technologies is the replication of fragmented analogue practices , to
the detriment of integrated, domain-specific technologies. For example,
communicating on issues in a BIM-based project via email and reports
produced with text processors and spreadsheets is redundant because most
BIM software includes facilities for reporting issues and making
calculations in direct connection with the model.

Domain-specific technologies, which attempt to structure AECO processes
and knowledge, exist in the diffuse zone between the two ends of the
spectrum. These try to offer more relevant alternatives to
general-purpose technologies, as well as connections to the abundance of
digital data. Currently paramount among them is BIM, an integrated
approach that is usually justified with respect to
performance.[[#chapter-002-digitization-in-aeco.xhtml#footnote-118-2][^{[2]}]]
Performance improvement through BIM requires intensive and extensive
collaboration, which adds to both the importance and the burden of
information. Integration in BIM and return on investment also require
coverage of most aspects of a project and put emphasis on larger
projects. Both comprehensive digitization and larger projects, however,
come against interoperability, capacity and coordination problems,
making BIM deployment even harder and often haphazard.

The end result is that AECO still resides in the mentality of
information overload. In a 2015
survey,[[#chapter-002-digitization-in-aeco.xhtml#footnote-118-3][^{[3]}]]
70% of AECO professionals claim that project information deluge actually
impedes effective collaboration, while 42% feel unable to integrate new
digital tools in their organizations. We have no reason to assume that
the problems have been alleviated since then. As information needs in
AECO have changed little since the 1980s, when digitization was in its
infancy, this suggests that the problem lies primarily not with the
unchanged quantities of information but with the way information is
accessed through the new, digital means. Therefore, the resulting
dissatisfaction with digitization cannot be dismissed as a teething
issue. If digitization approaches in AECO were successful, any such
issue would have been resolved long ago. Its persistence suggests
fundamental misunderstandings that impede the deployment of real
solutions to AECO information needs. AECO consequently appears to share
many of the problems of the digital information explosion without
enjoying adequate benefits from the information-processing opportunities
of the digital era.

* ORIGINS AND OUTCOMES
To identify and explain these misunderstandings, we have to go back in
history and look at the origins of AECO digitization. AECO has always
been an intensive producer and consumer of information. In fact, most of
its disciplines produce information on buildings rather than buildings,
primarily documents that specify what should be constructed and how.
Especially drawings have been a major commodity in AECO, both as a
widely accessible isomorphic representation of buildings and as a basis
for conceptualizing designs through geometry. Throughout the history of
AECO, drawings have been ubiquitous in all forms of specification and
communication, as well as quite effective in supporting all kinds of
decision making.

The history of digitization in AECO starts quite early, already in the
1960s, but with disparate ambitions. Some researchers were interested in
automating design (even to the extent of replacing human designers with
computers), while others were keen to computerize drawing. In the end,
the two ambitions coexisted in the scientific area of CAAD, where design
automation was generally treated as the real goal. 3D modelling was
acceptable, especially if directly linked to design processes, while
computerized drawing was largely left to software companies. With the
popularization of computers in the 1990s, however, it was computerized
drawing (CAD) that dominated AECO digitization in practice.

As with other software, the original use of CAD was the production of
analogue documents: conventional drawings like floor plans and bills of
materials on paper. For many years, the advantages of computerized
drawing were presented in terms of efficiency improvement over drawing
by hand on paper: faster production of drawings, easier modification and
compact storage. Even after the popularization of the Internet, the
emphasis on conventional documents remained. The only difference was
that, rather than working with paper-based documents only, one could
also produce and exchange digital files like PDFs.

In this manner, AECO information remained firmly entrenched in
conventional, document-based practices. While analogue documents like
telephone directories were being replaced by online information systems
and people adapted to having their day planners and address lists on
mobile phones or using navigation apps instead of maps, AECO stubbornly
stuck to analogue practices and documents, prolonging their life into
the digital era. This is evident even in BIM, which has stronger
relations to design automation than drawing computerization but still
retains drawings not only as the main output but also as the primary
interface with the information contained in a model.

A further consequence is that the digital AECO information comes in huge
amounts, with many and often large files that are poorly connected to
each other. The content of these files is accessible through separate,
usually proprietary software (as opposed to e.g. browsers that can
access all information on the Internet) and involves human interaction
and interpretation. The user remains the centre as well as the main
actor in information processing, which further increases the number of
documents, as users tend to summarize and combine sources. This reveals
the biggest problems of this file-inundated information landscape: more
than the amounts of information, file sizes and inefficient software,
they are redundancy (multiple files covering the same subjects with
considerable overlaps), lack of coherence (poor conceptual and
operational connections between these files) and low consistency
(different descriptions of the same aspects in various files and
different descriptions of related aspects).

* BIM: RADICAL INTENTIONS
The latest big chapter in the history of AECO digitization concerns BIM.
Drawing from product modelling, BIM emerged as a radical improvement of
computerized drawing that could provide a closer relation to design. The
difference with earlier attempts at design automation was that it did
not offer prescriptive means for generating a design but descriptive
support to designing: structured representation of buildings,
collaboration between AECO disciplines, integration of aspects and
smooth transition between phases. By doing so, it shifted attention from
drawings to the information they contained. At least, this is the
popular perception of BIM. Behind it, lies something more fundamental
that forms a recurring theme in this book: meaningful symbolic
representation.

The wide acceptance of BIM is unprecedented in AECO computerization.
Earlier attempts were often met with reluctance, not in the least for
the cost of hardware, software and training they required. By contrast,
the reception of BIM was much more positive, even though BIM is more
demanding than its predecessors in terms of cost (an issue that
nevertheless resurfaced after the initial euphoria). Arguably more than
its attention to information or collaboration, it was its apparent
simplicity (a Lego-like assembly of a building) that made BIM appealing,
especially to non-technical stakeholders. The arcane conventions and
practices of analogue drawing no longer seemed necessary or relevant.

Still, BIM remained rooted in these conventions. It may have moved from
the graphic to the symbolic but it did so through interfaces laden with
graphic conventions. For example, entering a wall in BIM is normally
done in a floor plan projection, in a fashion that largely replicates
analogue drawing: the user selects the wall type and then draws a line
to indicate its axis. As soon as the axis is drawn, the wall symbol
appears fully detailed according to the wall type that has been chosen:
lines, hatches and other graphic elements indicating the wall materials.
The axis is not among the normally visible graphic elements. Such
attachment to convention impedes users from understanding that they are
actually entering a symbol in the model rather than generating a
drawing.

More on such matters follows later in the book. For the moment, it
suffices to note that BIM signifies a step forward in AECO digitization
but remains a transitional technology that may confuse or obscure
fundamental information issues. Even so, as the currently best option
for AECO, it deserves particular attention and therefore constitutes the
main information environment in this book: representation and IM are
discussed in the framework of BIM. Future technologies are expected to
follow the symbolic character of BIM, so any strategies developed with
respect to BIM will probably remain applicable. It is telling that
current proposals on digital twins (representations that capture not
only the form and structure of buildings but also their behaviour, as
reported in real time by sensors in the real thing) generally depart
from BIM-like models.

* Limitations and necessities
The current digitization tendencies in AECO are dangerously confusing.
While digitization invites us to interpret and even experience the world
as information, AECO is still entrenched in analogue practices that keep
information implicit. This means that we miss the opportunity to develop
new conceptual models of reality, which are a prerequisite to
digitization and information processing by machines. Instead, we use the
old and arguably outdated analogue practices as the domain of discourse
(the stuff that should be digitized).

Equally limiting is that digitization in AECO still calls for human
interpretation, which runs contrary to the general tendency to remove
ourselves from the centre of the information world. As a result, the
explosively increasing amounts of digital information become a burden
rather than an opportunity: we still focus on the availability of
information for human consumption instead of on the
information-processing capacities of machines that can support us in
reliable, meaningful ways.

Even worse, the very availability of information may be underplayed.
While digitization in general makes increasingly difficult to claim
ignorance of anything, in AECO a project can be an isolated microworld
that fails to acknowledge what exists beyond its scope. Learning and
generalizing from precedents remains unsupported by AECO information
technologies but even within a project many silos persist. The brief and
budget, for example, are practically never integrated in the setup of a
model in BIM, thereby leaving powerful options for design guidance and
automation severely underutilized.

Such limitations do not merely affect IM; they also undermine decision
making. As we shall see in the chapter on decisions and information,
there is strong evidence that human thinking comprises two kinds of
processes. The first kind (Type 1) is fast, automatic, effortless and
nonconscious, while the second (Type 2) is slow, effortful, conscious
and controlled. Type 1 thinking dominates daily life and allows us to be
quite efficient in many common tasks but it also regularly leads to
errors, especially in complex tasks. Regrettably, we tend to rely too
much on the economical Type 1 processes and accept their products, even
in situations that clearly call for Type 2 thinking. For example, we
tend to make judgements on the basis of the limited information
available in our memory at a given moment (e.g. news stories of the past
few weeks), instead of taking the trouble to collect all relevant data
and analyse them properly before reaching a decision.

This type of thinking occurs only too frequently with respect to the
built environment: we become concerned about fire safety only after a
publicized disaster and then go into a frenzy of activity that
nevertheless soon subsides, especially if there is no similar disaster
to rekindle our interest or if a disaster of a different kind occurs,
even though the probability and risks of building fires remain the same.
Moreover, we do not exhibit the same concern about stair safety, despite
the fact that annually there are more victims of stair falls than of
building fires, probably because each stair fall usually involves only
one person, while a single building fire can have tens of victims.

That such problems are not restricted to AECO is not a consolation but a
further danger: studies of human decision making reveal that people take
decisions intuitively, on the basis of readily available rather than
necessary, well-structured information, even in sensitive, high-risk and
high-gain areas like finance. Share trading, for instance, is usually
presented as a highly skilled business but performance is not
consistent: it seems more a game of luck than one of skill. It is
therefore important to take such failures into account also when we try
to learn from other areas, especially with respect to management.

In addition to acknowledging and controlling our biases, so as to use
Type 2 processes more frequently and purposely, we must take care that
we always have access to the right information for these processes. This
information, structured in transparent and operational descriptions of a
task and its context, is the real goal for digitization in any AECO
project: it returns human-computer partnerships, where machines support
human decision making through extensive data collection, analysis and
representation. Note that this does not imply a lessening role for
humans in decision making. On the contrary, it adds to the capacities of
humans by facilitating Type 2 thinking through explicit information, as
well as by freeing resources for Type 2 processes.

The general conclusion is that AECO digitization is in urgent need of
substantial improvement but this improvement is not merely a matter of
importing new technologies as panaceas. The prerequisite to any change
is a thorough understanding of building information and how it relates
to our cognitive and social processes. As we shall see in the following
chapters, once this is achieved, all goals, including IM and decision
support, become clear and fundamentally feasible.

In the previous part we have considered how digitization affects our
treatment of information and our attitudes concerning information. We
have seen that there are marked differences between general tendencies
and what is happening in AECO. Many of the differences are due to the
way information is represented. Digitization relies heavily on symbolic
representations that allow efficient and reliable processing of
information contained in the symbols and their relations. This lessens
the importance of isomorphic representations like drawings, which retain
much of the visual appearance of the real things. In this part, we look
at the fundamental structure of symbolic representations, differences
with analogue representations and how the two come together in BIM, in a
way that exemplifies the transitional character of current AECO
digitization.

* Symbolic representation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/This chapter introduces symbolic representations: how they are
structured and how they describe things, including spatial ones. It
introduces graphs for the description of spatial symbolic
representations (which presupposes knowledge of the content of Appendix
I) and presents some of the advantages of such mathematical foundations.
The chapter concludes with the paradigmatic and syntagmatic dimensions
of representations, and their relevance for interpretation and
management./

* Symbolic representations
Many of the misunderstandings concerning information occur when people
do not appreciate what representations are and how they convey
information. Representations are so central to our thinking that even if
the sender of some information fails to structure it in a
representation, the receiver does so automatically. A representation can
be succinctly defined as a system for describing a particular class of
entities. The result of applying a representation to an entity is a
/description/. Representations of the symbolic kind, which proliferate
human societies, consist of two main components:

- A set of symbols, usually finite
- Some rules for linking these symbols to the entities they describe

The decimal numeral system is such a symbolic representation. Its
symbols are the familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals:

/S/_{/D/} = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

The rules by which these symbols are linked to the quantities they
describe can be summarized as follows:

/n/_{/n/} · 10^{/n/} + /n/_{/n/-1 }· 10^{/n/-1 } + ... + /n/_{1 }· 10^{1
}+ /n/_{0 }· 10^{0 }

These rules underlie positional notation, i.e. the description of a
quantity as:

/n/_{/n/}/n/_{/n/-1 }.... /n/_{1}/n/_{0}

For example, the description of seventeen becomes:

1 · 10^{1} + 7 · 10^{0} ⇒ 17

The binary numeral system is essentially similar. Its symbol set
consists of only two numerals and its rules employ two as base instead
of ten:

/S/_{/B/} = {0,1}

/n/_{/n/} · 2^{/n/} + /n/_{/n/-1 }· 2^{/n/-1 } .+ ... + /n/_{1 }· 2^{1}
+ /n/_{0 }· 2^{0 }

This means that seventeen becomes:

1 · 2^{4} + 0 · 2^{3} + 0 · 2^{2} + 0 · 2^{1} + 1 · 2^{0} ⇒ 10001

There are often alternative representations for the same class of
entities. Quantities, for example, can be represented by (from left to
right) Roman, decimal and binary numerals, as well as one of many tally
mark systems:

XVII = 17 = 10001 = IIII IIII IIII II

A representation makes explicit only certain aspects of the described
entities. The above numerical representations concern quantity. They
tell us, for example, that there are seventeen persons in a room. The
length, weight, age and other features of these persons are not
described. For these, one needs different representations.

Each representation has its advantages. Decimal numerals, for example,
are considered appropriate for humans because we have ten fingers that
can be used as an aid to calculation. Being built out of components with
two states (on and off), computers are better suited to binary numerals.
However, when it comes to counting ongoing quantities, like people
boarding a ship, tally marks are better suited to the task. Some
representations may be not particularly good at anything: it has been
suggested that despite their brilliance at geometry, ancient Greeks and
Romans failed to develop other branches of mathematics to a similar
level because they lacked helpful numeral representations.

We should also appreciate that representation are heavily constrained by
their /implementation mechanisms:/ the things physically used to make
them. Cuneiform characters, for example, are strongly related to they
styli used for imprinting them on clay tablets: the strokes one could
make with these styli on clay. Interestingly, such strokes remained the
basis of subsequent writing systems. This suggests that some elements of
a representation are transferred from one technology to another, despite
the changes in implementation. At the same time, such transitions form a
clear progress towards minimizing effort and increasing speed in
writing, regardless of script or language.

From an IM viewpoint, symbolic representations are the culmination of a
long process of trying to order information into discrete parcels and
networks that link them. In this process, we encounter many technologies
for organizing large quantities of information, for example card-filing
systems, indices, dictionaries and encyclopaedias. In an illustration of
the significance of information for management, the structure such
technologies provide connects to attempts to order the world and
organize our interactions with it. This is something many states and
businesses discovered in the nineteenth century, when many of these
technologies took off. For example, classifications of professions,
races, genders etc. were reduced to what the technologies afforded,
sometimes with deleterious effects. Symbolic representations concluded
the process and allowed use of the computer as an information and
communication device by supporting the parsing of the content of any
document into symbols and relations that can be easily digitized.

* Symbols and things
The correspondence between symbols in a representation and the entities
they denote may be less than perfect. This applies even to the Latin
alphabet, one of the most successful symbolic representations and a
cornerstone of computerization. The letters (phonograms) that describe
sounds (phonemes) in a language are a very compact set of symbols that
afford a more economical way of describing words than syllabaries or
logographies (graphemes corresponding to syllables or things and ideas).
Using the Latin alphabet as the symbol set turns a computerized text
into a string of ASCII characters that combine to form all possible
words and sentences. Imagine how different text processing in the
computer would be if its symbols were not alphabetic characters but
pixels or lines like the strokes we make to form the characters in
handwriting.

At the same time, the correspondence between letters in the Latin
alphabet and phonemes in the languages that employ them is not
straightforward. In English, for example, the letter ‘A' may denote
different phonemes:

- ɑ: (as in ‘car')
- æ (as in ‘cat')
- ɒ (as in ‘call')
- ə (as in ‘alive')
- ɔ: (as in ‘talk')

The digraph TH can be either:

- θ (as in ‘think') or
- ð (as in ‘this')

Conversely, the phoneme eɪ can be written either as:

- AY (as in ‘say')
- EI (as in ‘eight')

The lesson we learn from these examples is that abstraction and context
are important in representation. Abstraction allows for less strict yet
reasonably clear relations between symbols and things: the letter ‘A'
represents only vowels, moreover of a similar kind. A one-to-many
correspondence like that is trickier than a simple one-to-one relation
but is usually clarified thanks to the context, in our case proximal
alphabetic symbols: ‘car' and ‘cat' are very similar strings but most
English learners soon learn that they are pronounced differently and
associate the right phoneme rather than the letter with the word.
Similarly, in the floor plan of a building one soon learns to
distinguish between two closely spaced lines denoting a wall and two
very similar lines representing a step (Figure 1).

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. Walls and step in a floor plan: both entities are
represented by two closely spaced parallel lines/
[[file:media/assets/walls_stairs-1-300x288-1.png]]

 

* Spatial symbolic representations
Symbolic representations are also used for spatial entities. Familiar
examples are metro and similar public transport maps. A common
characteristic of many such maps is that they started life as lines
drawn on a city map to indicate the route of each metro line and the
position of the stations (Figure 2). As the size and complexity of the
transport networks increased, the metro lines and stations were
liberated from the city maps and became separate, diagrammatic maps:
spatial symbolic representations, comprising symbols for stations and
connections between stations (Figure 3).

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Metro lines and stations on a city map/
[[file:media/assets/metro-cropped-1024x721-1.jpg]]

#+begin_html
  <figcaption id="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-caption-text">
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  </figcaption>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

In these maps, the symbols are similar for each line but can be
differentiated by means of shape or colour, so that one can distinguish
between lines. The symbol set for a metro network comprising two lines
(the red O line and the blue Plus line) would therefore consist of the
station symbol for the red line, the station symbol for the blue line,
the connection symbol for the red line and the connection symbol for the
blue line:

/S/_{/M/} = {o, +, |_{o}, |_{+} }

#+caption: /Figure 3. Metro map/
[[file:media/assets/metro_normalized-1024x695-1.png]]

 

The rules that connect these symbols to real-world entities can be
summarized as follows:

- Each station on a metro line (regardless of the complexity of the
  building that accommodates it) is represented by a station symbol of
  that line
- Each part of the rail network that connects two stations of the same
  line is represented by a line symbol of that line

These common-sense, practical principles underlie many intuitive
attempts at spatial representation and, as discussed later on, even a
branch of mathematics that provides quite useful and powerful means for
formalizing and analysing symbolic spatial representations.

Our familiarity with metro maps is to a large degree due to their
legibility and usability, which make them excellent illustrations of the
strengths of a good representation. As descriptions of an urban
transport system, they allow for easy and clear travel planning,
facilitate recognition of interchanges and connections, and generally
provide clear overview and support easy understanding. To manage all
that, metro maps tend to be abstract and diagrammatic (as in Figure 3),
in particular by simplifying the geometry of the metro lines (usually
turning them into straight lines) and normalizing distances between
stations (often on the basis of a grid). As a consequence, metro
diagrams are inappropriate for measuring geometric distances between
stations. Still, as travelling times on a metro primarily depend on the
number of stations to be traversed, metro maps can be used to estimate
the time a trip may take. However, for finding the precise location of a
station, city maps are far more useful.

A comparison of metro maps to numerals shows that the increase in
dimensionality necessitates explicit representation of relations between
symbols. In the one-dimensional numerals, relations are implicit yet
unambiguous: positional notation establishes a strict order that makes
evident which numeral stands for hundreds in a decimal number and how it
relates to the numerals denoting thousands and tens. Similarly, in an
alphabetic text (also a one-dimensional representation), spaces and
punctuation marks are used to indicate the clustering of letters into
words, sentences and paragraphs, and thus facilitate understanding of
not only phonemes but also meanings in the text.

In two-dimensional representations like the metro diagrams, proximity
between two station symbols does not suffice for inferring the precise
relation between them. One needs an explicit indication like a line that
connects the two symbols. A metro map missing such a connection
(Figure 4) is puzzling and ambiguous: does the missing connection mean
that a metro line is still under development or simply that the drawings
is incomplete by mistake? Interestingly, such an omission in a metro
diagram is quite striking and does not normally go unnoticed, triggering
questions and interpretations, which will be discussed in the chapter on
data and information (in relation to anti-data).

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. Metro map missing a connection between stations/
[[file:media/assets/metro_normalized_disconnected-1024x695-1.png]]

Similarly puzzling is a metro map where stations of different lines are
close to each other, even touching (Figure 5): does this indicate that
the stations are housed in the same building, so that one can change
from one line to the other, or that the stations are close by but
separate, in which case one has to exit the metro and enter it again
(which may involve having to buy a new ticket)? In a metro map where
stations are clearly connected or coincide (Figure 3), there is no such
ambiguity concerning interchange possibilities.

#+end_html

 

* Graphs
Diagrams like these metro maps are /graphs/: mathematical structures
that describe pairwise relations between things (for a summary of graph
theory see Appendix I). In Figure 3, each metro station is a vertex and
each connection between two stations an edge. Graphs have a wide range
of applications, from computer networks and molecular structures to the
organization of a company or a family tree, because the tools supplied
by graph theory help quantify many features and aspects. For example,
the /degree/ of a vertex is a good indication of complexity. In a metro
map, it indicates the number of lines that connect there. The only
interchange in Figure 3 is easy to identify by its degree (4), as are
the end stations of the two lines, which are /leaves/.

The /degree sequence/ of a graph obviously helps with similar aspects.
In a map of a metro line (i.e. the subgraph consisting of the vertices
and edges belonging to the line), this sequence is a good indication of
opportunities for crossing over to other lines, as well as of how busy
the line and its stations may become as passengers avail themselves of
these opportunities.

The /eccentricity/ of a metro station relates to its remoteness or poor
connectivity. The /diameter/ of the graph indicates the extent of
remoteness in the metro network. Together with the /radius, /they are
used to detect the /center/ and the /periphery/ of the graph:
respectively, the well-connected part where most things happen and the
more quiet part where little happens.

Finally, in order to be able to travel on the metro, the graph has to be
/connected:/ each vertex should connect to every other vertex by some
path (the graph in Figure 5 is therefore not connected). Connectivity is
affected by /bridges/. In our metro example, all edges are bridges,
making the metro particularly sensitive: any problem between two
stations renders it partly unusable, as passengers cannot move along
alternative routes.

What the above examples illustrate is that a well-structured
representation can rely on mathematical tools that help formalize its
structure and analyses. This is important for two reasons: firstly,
formalization makes explicit what one may recognize intuitively in a
representation; secondly, it supports automation, especially of
analyses. Allowing computers to perform painstaking and exhaustive
analyses complements, liberates and enhances the creative capacities of
humans.

* Graphs and buildings
Graph-like representations are also used for buildings. Architects, for
example, use bubble and relationship diagrams to express schematically
the spatial structure of a design (Figure 3). In such diagrams, nodes
usually denote spaces where some specific activities take place (e.g.
“Expositions” or “Library”), while edges or overlaps indicate proximity
or direct access.

 

#+caption: /Figure 6. Relationship diagram/
[[file:media/assets/image1-1024x512-1.png]]

On the basis of graph theory, more formal versions of these diagrams
have been developed, such as /access graphs/. Here nodes represent
spaces and edges openings like doors, which afford direct connection
between spaces. Access graphs are particularly useful for analysing
circulation in a
building.[[#chapter-003-representation.xhtml#footnote-68-1][^{[1]}]]

#+caption: /Figure 7. Floor plan and its access graph/
[[file:media/assets/floor-plan-and-access-graph-1024x300-1.png]]

The access graph demonstrates the significance of explicit structure:
pictorially it may have few advantages over relationship diagrams, as
both make explicit the entities in a representation and their relations.
However, imposing the stricter principles of a mathematical structure
reduces vagueness and provides access to useful mathematical tools. In a
relationship diagram one may use both edges and overlaps to indicate
relations, and shapes, colours and sizes to indicate properties of the
nodes. In a graph, one must use only vertices and edges, and label them
with the necessary attributes. This improves consistency and clarity in
representation, similarly to the standardization of spelling in a
language. It also facilitates application of mathematical measures which
give clear indications of design performance. For example, the
eccentricity of the node representing the space from where one may exit
a building is a useful measure of how long it may take for people to
leave the building, which is critical for e.g. fire egress. Similarly,
the significance of a space for pedestrian circulation is indicated by
its degree in the access graph, while edges that form bridges are
doorways that cut off a part of the building when closed. This makes
them potential bottlenecks in pedestrian circulation but also opportune
control points, e.g. for security checks: points of singular importance,
either as threats or as opportunities. For all these reasons, graphs are
a representational basis to which we will returning in this book.

* Paradigmatic and syntagmatic dimensions
In a symbolic representation we can analyse descriptions along two
dimensions: the paradigmatic and the
syntagmatic.[[#chapter-003-representation.xhtml#footnote-68-2][^{[2]}]]
The paradigmatic dimension concerns the symbols in the representation,
e.g. letters in a text. The syntagmatic dimension refers to the sequence
by which these symbols are entered in the description. The meaning of
the description relies primarily on the paradigmatic dimension: the
symbols and their arrangement in the description. Syntagmatic aspects
may influence the form of these symbols and their arrangement but above
all reveal much about the cognitive and social processes behind the
representation and its application, as well as mechanical aspects. For
instance, in a culture where left-to-right writing is dominant, one
would expect people to write numerals from left to right, too. However,
the Dutch language uses a ten-before-unit structure for number words
between 21 and 99 (as opposed to the unit-and-ten structure in English),
e.g. “vijfentwintig” (five-and-twenty). Consequently, when writing by
hand, e.g. noting down a telephone number dictated by someone else, one
often sees Dutch people first enter the ten numeral, leaving space for
the unit, and then backtrack to that space to enter the unit numeral.
With a computer keyboard such backtracking is not possible, so the
writer normally pauses while listening to the ten numeral, waits for the
unit numeral and then enters them in the reverse order. Matching the
oral representation to the written one may involve such syntagmatic
peculiarities, which are moreover constrained by the implementation
means of the representation (writing by hand or typing).

In drawing by hand, one may use a variety of guidelines, including
perspective, grid and frame lines, which prescribe directions, relations
and boundaries. These lines are normally entered first in the drawing,
either during the initial setup or when the need for guidance emerges.
The graphic elements of the building representation are entered
afterwards, often in direct reference to the guidelines: if a graphic
element has to terminate on a guideline, one may draw it from the
guideline or, if one starts from the opposite direction, slow down while
approaching the guideline, so as to ensure clear termination. Similar
constraining influences may also derive from already existing graphic
elements in the drawing: consciously or unconsciously one might keep new
graphic elements parallel or similarly sized as previously entered ones,
terminate them against existing lines etc. Such mechanical and
proportional dependence on existing graphic elements has led to the
development of a wide range of object-snap options and alignment
facilities in computerized drawing.

Any analysis of the paradigmatic dimension in a description aims at
identifying symbols, e.g. relating each stroke in a handwritten text to
a letter. To do that, one has to account for every stroke with respect
to not only all symbols available in the representation but also various
alternatives and variations, such as different styles of handwriting.
Analyses of the syntagmatic dimension have to take into account not only
the paradigmatic dimension (especially symbols and implementation
mechanisms) but also cognitive, social, mechanical aspects that may have
played a role in the temporal process of making a description, such as
the tendency to draw /from/ an existing graphic element to ensure clear
termination. Similarly, in most BIM editors, one enters openings like
doors or windows only after the walls that host them have been entered
in the model and rooms are defined only after the bounding walls have
been completed.

As all this relates to the organization of a design project and the
relations between members of a design team, the syntagmatic dimension is
of particular relevance to the management of information processes.
Thankfully, there are sufficient tools for registering changes in a
digital representation: adding a timestamp to the creation, modification
and eventual deletion of a symbol in a computer program is easy and
computationally inexpensive. Making sense of what these changes mean
requires thorough analysis of the sequences registered and clear
distinctions between possible reasons for doing things in a particular
order.

The significance of the syntagmatic dimension increases with the
dimensionality of the representation: in a one-dimensional
representation like a text, the sequence by which letters are entered is
quite predictable, including peculiarities like the way Dutch words for
numbers between 21 and 99 are structured. In representations with two or
more dimensions, one may enter symbols in a variety of ways, starting
from what is important or opportune and moving iteratively through the
description until it is complete (although completeness may be difficult
to ascertain syntagmatically, making uncertain when the process should
terminate). This clearly indicates the significance of the syntagmatic
dimension for the management of 3D and 4D representations of buildings.

* Analogue representations
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/To understand many of the problems surrounding building information, we
first need to examine the analogue representations that still persist in
AECO. This chapter presents some of the key characteristics that have
made these representations so successful but do not necessarily agree
with digital environments. Effective computerization replaces the human
abilities that enable analogue representations with capacities for
information processing by machines./

* Pictorial representations and geometry
Familiar building representations tend to be drawings on paper, such as
orthographic projections like floor plans and sections, and projective
ones, including isometrics and axonometrics: two-dimensional depictions
of three-dimensional scenes, through which one tries to describe the
spatial arrangement, construction or appearance of a building. What
these drawings have in common is:

- They are pictorial representations (not symbolic)
- They rely heavily on geometry

Even though drawings were used in building design already in antiquity,
it was in the Renaissance that applied geometry revolutionized the way
Europeans represented and conceptualized space, in many cases raising
the importance of the graphic image over the written text. Geometry was
not merely a handy foundation for descriptive purposes, i.e. formalizing
pictorial representations of buildings, but also a means of ordering
space, i.e. organizing people's experiences and thoughts to reveal some
inherent order (including that of the cosmos). Consequently, building
drawings evolved from schematic to precise and detailed representations
that matched the perception of actual buildings, as well as most levels
of decision making and communication about building design and
construction.

This gave geometry a central position in building design. Many
architects and engineers became engrossed in geometric explorations
closely linked to some presumed essence or ambition of their profession.
With geometry both an overlay and underlay to reality, a complex
relation developed between building design and geometry, involving not
only the shape of the building but also the shape of its drawings. In
turn, this caused building drawings to become semantically and
syntactically dense pictorial representations, where any pictorial
element, however small, can be significant for interpretation. In
comparison to more diagrammatic representations, the interpretation of
building drawings involves a larger number of pictorial elements,
properties and aspects, such as colour, thickness, intensity and
contrast. As representations, building drawings were therefore
considered a mixed and transitional
case.[[#chapter-004-analogue-representations.xhtml#footnote-88-1][^{[1]}]]

The computerization of such complex, highly conventional analogue
representations was initially superficial, aiming at faithful
reproduction of their appearance. To many, the primary function of
digital building representations, including not only CAD but also BIM,
is the production of conventional analogue drawings either on paper
(prints) or as digital facsimiles (e.g. a PDF of a floor plan). This
makes computerization merely an efficiency improvement, especially
concerning ease of drawing modification, compactness of storage and
speed of dissemination. This is a testimony to the power and success of
analogue building drawings but at the same time a major limitation to a
fuller utilization of the information-processing capacities of
computers. Analogue drawings work well in conjunction with human
abilities for visual recognition, allowing us to develop efficient and
effective means of specification and communication. For example, most
people recognize the same number of spaces in a floor plan on paper;
scanning the floor plan transforms it into a computer file but computers
generally only recognize it as an array of pixels. Recognizing the rooms
and counting them by computer requires explicit representation of
spaces.

* Visual perception and recognition
Building drawings are surprisingly parsimonious: they manage to achieve
quite a lot with a limited repertory of graphic primitives. With just a
few kinds of lines, they produce floor plans, sections, perspectives
etc., as well as depict a wide variety of shapes and materials in all
these projections. To a large degree this is thanks to the ingenious
ways they trigger the human visual system and allow us to see things.
For example, we tend to associate similar elements if they are proximal.
Therefore, two closely parallel lines become one: the depiction of a
wall. But if the distance between the lines increases beyond what might
be plausible for a thick wall, they become just parallel lines. Seeing
two lines as a wall does not necessarily mean they have to be strictly
parallel or straight (Figure 1).

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. In a floor plan, closely spaced parallel lines are
often paired into depictions of walls (left); if the distance between
parallel lines increases, perceiving them as walls becomes hard or
impossible (middle); perturbations or irregularities do not necessarily
disqualify closely spaced, roughly parallel lines as wall depictions
(right)/
[[file:media/assets/wall-lines-1024x260-1.png]]

 

It is similarly easy to identify columns in a floor plan. Even more
significantly, the arrangement (repetition, collinearity, proximity
etc.) and similarity of columns allow us to recognize colonnades: groups
of objects with a specific character (Figure 2). A colonnade may be
recognizable even when the columns are not identical and their
arrangement not completely regular (Figure 3). However, if the
arrangement is truly irregular, proximity or similarity do not suffice
for the recognition of a colonnade (Figure 4).

* Abstraction and incompleteness
Pictorial representations are characterized by a high potential for
abstraction, which is evident in the different scales of building
drawings: a wall at a scale like 1:20 is depicted by a large number of
lines indicating various layers and materials; at 1:100 the wall may be
reduced to just two parallel lines; at 1:500 it may even become a
single, relatively thick line. Similarly, a door in a floor plan at 1:20
is quite detailed (Figure 6), at 1:100 it is abstracted into a depiction
that primarily indicates the door type (Figure 7) and at 1:500 it
becomes just a hole in a wall (Figure 8). At all three scales both the
wall and the door are clearly recognizable, albeit at different scales
of specificity and detail. Such abstraction is largely visual: it mimics
the perception of a drawing (or, for that matter, of any object) from
various distances. It also corresponds to the design priorities in
different stages. In early, conceptual design, one tends to focus on
general issues, zooming out of the drawing to study larger parts, while
deferring details to later stages. Therefore, the precise type, function
and construction of a door may be relatively insignificant, making
abstraction at the scale of 1:500 suitable. However, that abstraction
level is inappropriate for the final technical design, when one has to
specify not just the function and construction of a door but also its
interfacing with the wall. To do so, one has to zoom in and use a scale
like 1:20 to view and settle all details.

In addition to visual abstraction, one may also reduce common or
pertinent configurations, however complex, into a single, named entity,
e.g. an Ionic or Corinthian column, a colonnade (Figure 2) or “third
floor” and “north wing”. Such mnemonic or conceptual abstraction is
constrained by visual recognition, as outlined above, but also relies on
cultural convention: it is clearly not insignificant that we have a term
for a colonnade. As a result, mnemonic abstraction plays a more
important role in symbolic representation than purely visual
abstraction.

Pictorial representations are also relatively immune to incompleteness:
a hastily drawn line on paper, with bits missing, is still perceived as
a line (Figure 9). A house partially occluded by an obstacle is
similarly perceived as a single, complete and coherent entity (Figure
10).

Dealing with incomplete descriptions is generally possible because not
all parts are critical for understanding their meaning, even if they are
not redundant. In English, for example, keeping only the consonants in a
text may suffice for recognizing most words:

TH QCK BRWN FX JMPS VR TH LZY DG

(THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG)

This practice, currently known as disenvoweling, is widely applied in
digital short messages. In the past, it was used to similar effect by
telegraph operators, note takers and others who wanted to economize on
message length and the time and effort required for writing or
transmitting a message. Identifying the missing vowels is often a matter
of context: ‘DG' in a farmyard setting probably means ‘DOG' but in an
archaeological one it may stand for ‘DIG'. If a word contains many
vowels, it may be hard even then: ‘JMPS' is highly probably ‘JUMPS' in
most contexts but ‘DT' as a shorthand of ‘IDIOT' may be far from
effective in any context.

Likewise in images, some parts are more critical than others for
recognition. A basic example is dashed lines: even with half of the line
missing, the human visual system invariably recognizes the complete
lines and the shapes they form (Figure 11).

 

#+caption: /Figure 11. A square drawn with dashed lines/

  </figcaption>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

Interestingly, a shape drawn with dashed lines is more easily recognized
if the line junctions are present. This relates to a general tendency of
the human visual system to rely on points of maximum curvature in the
outline of
shapes.[[#chapter-004-analogue-representations.xhtml#footnote-88-2][^{[2]}]]
Corners, in particular, are quite important: the presence of corners
often suffices for the perception of illusory figures (Figure 12). The
form of a corner gives perceivers quite specific expectations concerning
the position and form of other corners connected to it, even if the
geometry is curvilinear (Figure 13). The presence of compatible corners
in the image leads to perception of an illusory figure occluding other
forms. Perception of the illusory figure weakens if occlusion occurs at
non-critical parts of the figure, such as the middle of its sides
(Figure 14).

The importance of corners underlay one of the early successes in
artificial intelligence. Based on a typology of edge junctions (Figure
15), expectations about the connectivity of these types and the
orientation of resulting surfaces, computers were able to recognize the
composition of scenes with trihedral geometric forms: faces, volumes and
their relative positions (Figure
16).[[#chapter-004-analogue-representations.xhtml#footnote-88-3][^{[3]}]]

The above examples illustrate how analogue representations can be
parsimonious and simultaneously effective but only if complemented with
quite advanced and expensive recognition capacities. Empowering
computers with such capacities is an emerging future but for the moment
at least symbolic representations that contain explicit information are
clearly preferable.

* Implementation mechanisms
Symbols can exist in various environments, so we use means appropriate
to each environment for their implementation. A letter of the alphabet
can be handwritten on paper with ink or graphite particles, depending on
the writing implement (although one might claim that the strokes that
comprise the letter are the real implementation mechanisms with respect
to both the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic dimensions). In the
computer, the same letter is implemented as an ASCII character in a text
processing, spreadsheet and similar programs. In a drawing program, it
may comprise pixels or vectors corresponding to the strokes (depending
on the type of the program). In all cases, the symbol (the letter) is
the same; what changes are the implementation mechanisms used for it.

In analogue building representations, the overemphasis on geometry
results in a dominance of implementation mechanisms over symbols. As
geometric primitives are the graphic implementation mechanisms in
pictorial building representations (underlay) and geometry exercises
significant ordering influence on building design (overlay), it has been
easy to sidetrack attention to the geometric implementation mechanism of
building representations, not only in the analogue but also in the
digital versions. This geometric fixation meant lack of progress in CAD
and many misunderstandings in BIM.

To understand the true significance of geometric implementation
mechanisms for the symbols in a building representation, consider the
differences between alternative depictions of the same door in a floor
plan (Figure 17). Despite differences between the graphic elements and
their arrangement, they all carry the same information and are therefore
equivalent and interchangeable. Many people reading the floor plan are
unlikely to even notice such differences in notation, even in the same
drawing, especially if the doors are not placed close to each other.

 

#+caption: /Figure 17. Alternative depictions of the same door/

  </figcaption>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

Using different door depictions for the same door type in the same
drawing makes little sense. Differences in notation normally indicate
different types of doors (Figure 18): they trigger comparisons that
allow us to identify that there are different door types in the design
and facilitate recognition of the precise differences between these
types, so as to be able to judge the utility of each instance in the
design. These differences are meaningful for understanding the depicted
design, not accidental variations or stylistic preferences. In both
Figure 17 and 18, we recognize doors but the differences in
implementation mechanisms matter only in Figure 18, where they derive
from the differences between the door types.

In conclusion, one of the key advantages of symbolic representations is
the preeminence of symbols and the attenuation of confusion between
symbols and implementation mechanisms. In computerized texts, letters
are not formed by handwritten strokes that produce the required
appearance; the appearance of letters is added to the letter symbols
through properties like font and size. Analogue building representations
are similar to handwritten texts in that they may put too much emphasis
on graphic elements because it is only through the interpretation of
these that one can know e.g. the materials and layers that comprise a
wall. In a symbolic representation, the materials and composition of the
wall are explicit properties of an explicit symbol: we do not have to
infer them from the graphics in a drawing. As these properties are
described alphanumerically, symbolic representation removes ambiguity
and makes visual displays like drawings just one of the possible views
of building information.

* Building representation in BIM
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/This chapter approaches BIM as a symbolic building representation and
explains its key differences from analogue representations and their
facsimiles in CAD. It analyses how a model is built out of symbols that
may have an uneasy correspondence with real-world objects and how
abstraction applies to these symbols. It concludes with a view of models
as graphs that reveals what is still missing in BIM. /

* Symbols and relations in BIM

BIM is the first generation of truly symbolic digital building
representations.[[#chapter-005-building-representation-in-bim.xhtml#footnote-26-1][^{[1]}]]
CAD also used discrete symbols but these referred to implementation
mechanisms: the geometric primitives that comprised a symbol in analogue
representations. In BIM, the symbols explicitly describe discrete
building elements or spaces --- not their drawings. BIM symbols usually
come in “libraries” of elements, i.e. predefined symbols of various
types. The types can be specific, such as windows of a particular kind
by a certain manufacturer or abstract, e.g. single-hung sash windows, or
even just generic windows. The hierarchical relations between types
enable specificity and abstraction in the representation, e.g. deferring
the choice of a precise window type to a later design stage, without
missing information that is essential for the present stage, as all
currently relevant properties of the window, e.g. its size and position,
exist in a generic window symbol.

Entering an instance of a symbol in a model normally follows the next
procedure:

- The user selects the symbol type from a library menu or palette
- The user positions and dimensions the instance in a geometric view
  like a floor plan, usually interactively by:
  - Clicking on an insertion point for the location of the instance,
    e.g. on the part of a wall where a window should be
  - Clicking on other points to indicate the window width and height
    relative to the insertion point (this only if the window does not
    have a fixed size)

Modifications of the instance are performed in three complementary ways:

- Changes of essential properties such as the materials of a component
  amount to change of type. This is done by selecting a different symbol
  type from the library menu or palette and linking it to the instance.
- Changes in the geometry of an instance involve either repositioning
  the reference points or numerically changing the relevant values in
  any of the ways allowed by the program interface: in dialogue boxes
  that pop up by right-clicking on the instance, in properties palettes,
  through dimension lines or schedules.
- Changes in additional properties that do not conflict with the type,
  e.g. the occupancy of a space or the stage where a wall should be
  demolished, are entered through similar facilities in the interface,
  like a properties palette. Some of these properties are built in the
  symbols, while others can be defined by the user.

BIM symbols make all properties explicit, whether geometric or
alphanumeric. The materials of a building element are not inferred from
its graphic appearance but are clearly stated among its properties,
indicated either specifically or abstractly, e.g. “oak” or “wood”. Most
properties in an instance are inherited from the type. This concerns not
just materials but also any fixed dimensions: each wall type typically
has a fixed cross section. This ensures consistency in the
representation by keeping all similar elements and components truly
similar in all critical respects. Consistency is essential for many
tasks, such as cost estimation or procurement.

Many of the relations between symbols are present in BIM, even if they
are not always obvious or directly accessible. Openings like doors and
windows, for example, are hosted by a wall. They are normally entered in
a model after the wall has been placed and in strict connection to it:
moving a window out of the hosting wall is not allowed. Connected walls
may also have a specific relation, e.g. co-termination: if one is moved,
the others follow suit, staying connected in the same manner. Similarly,
spaces know their bounding elements (which also precede them in the
representation) and if any of these is modified, they automatically
adapt themselves. Through such relations, many links between symbols are
hidden in BIM. A door schedule, for example, (Figure 1) reveals that, in
addition to its hosting wall, a door knows which two spaces it connects
(or separates when closed).

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. A door schedule in BIM reveals that each door is
aware of the spaces it connects/
[[file:media/assets/door-schedule.png]]

#+end_html

 

Quite important is the explicit symbolic representation of both the
‘solids' out of which a building is constructed (building elements like
walls, floors, doors and windows) and the ‘voids' of the building (the
spaces bounded by the building elements). In analogue representations,
the spaces are normally implicit, i.e. inferred by the reader. Having
them explicit in BIM means that we can manipulate them directly and,
quite significantly from the perspective of this book, attach to them
information that cannot be linked to building elements. Similarly to
specifying that a window is made of sustainable wood, one can specify
that a space is intended for a particular use, e.g. “office” or for
specific activities like “small group meeting” or “CEO's meeting room”.
Such characterizations relate to various requirements (usually found in
the brief), such as floor area and performance specifications, e.g.
acoustics or daylighting, which can also be attached to the space and
used to guide and evaluate the design. Making spaces explicit in the
representation therefore allows for full integration of building
information in BIM and, through that, higher specificity and certainty.
Spaces, after all, are the main reason and purpose of buildings, and
most aspects are judged by how well spaces accommodate user activities.

* BIM symbols and things
BIM has many advantages but, in common with other symbolic
representations, also several ambiguities. One of the most important
concerns the correspondence between symbols and real-world things.
Building representations in BIM are truly symbolic, comprising discrete
symbols. Unfortunately, the structure of building elements often
introduces fuzziness in the definition of these symbols. In general,
there are two categories of ‘solids' in buildings. The first is building
elements that are adequately represented by discrete symbols. Doors and
windows, for example, are normally complete assemblies that are
accommodated in a hole in a wall. Walls, on the other hand, are typical
representatives of the second category: conceptual entities that are
difficult to handle in three respects. Firstly, walls tend to consist of
multiple layers of brickwork, insulation, plaster, paint and other
materials. Some of these layers continue into other elements: the inner
brick layer of an external wall may become the main layer of internal
walls, forming a large, complex and continuous network that is locally
incorporated in various walls (Figure 2).

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Continuous brick layer locally incorporated in two
different kinds of wall/
[[file:media/assets/external_internal_wall_network.png]]

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

 

Secondly, BIM retains some of the geometric bias of earlier building
representations, for example in the definition of elements like walls
that have a fixed cross section but variable length or shape. When users
have to enter the axis of a wall to describe this length or shape, they
inevitably draw a geometric shape. BIM usually defines symbols on the
basis of the most fundamental primitives in this shape. Even if one uses
e.g. a rectangle to describe the axis, the result is four interconnected
yet distinct walls, each corresponding to a side of the rectangle.
Similarly, a wall with a complex shape but conceptually and practically
unmistakably a single, continuous structure, may be analysed into
several walls, each corresponding to a line segment of its axis (Figure
3).

 

#+caption: /Figure 3. The internal wall is a single, continuous
structure but in BIM each segment may be represented as a distinct
wall /
[[file:media/assets/internal_wall_network.png]]

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

 

Thirdly, our own perception of elements like walls may get in the way.
Standing on one side of a wall, we see only the portion of the wall that
bounds the room we are in. Standing on the other side, we perceive not
only a different face but possibly also a different part of the wall
(Figure 4). As a result, when thinking from the perspective of either
space, we refer to parts of the same entity as if they were different
walls.

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. Three different views of the same wall/
[[file:media/assets/three-perceived-walls.png]]

#+begin_html
  </figure>
#+end_html

 

The inevitable conclusion is that some symbols in BIM may require
further processing when considered with respect to particular goals. One
may have to analyse a symbol into parts that are then combined with
parts of other symbols, e.g. for scheduling the construction of the
brick network in Figure 2. Other symbols must be grouped together by the
user, for instance the internal wall in Figure 3. Such manipulations
should not reduce the integrity of the symbols; it makes little sense to
represent each layer of a wall separately. At the same time, one has to
be both consistent and pragmatic in the geometric definition of building
elements. In most cases, acceptance of the BIM preference for the
simplest possible geometry is the least painful option: representing
each of the two internal walls in Figure 4 as a single, separate entity
is a compromise that accommodates all perspectives, including those
indicated in the figure.

* Abstraction and grouping in BIM
BIM symbols cover a wide range of abstraction levels, from generic
symbols like “internal wall” without any further specifications to
highly detailed symbols, e.g. of a very specific wall type, including
precise descriptions of materials from particular manufacturers. A
building representation in BIM often starts with abstract symbols, which
become progressively more specific, in parallel with the design or
construction process. It is also possible to backtrack to a higher
abstraction level rather than sidestep to a different type on the same
level, e.g. when some conflict resolution leads to a dead end and one
needs to reconsider their options. This typologic abstraction is one of
the strong points of BIM but also something one has to treat with care
because a model may contain symbols at various abstraction levels.
Managing the connections between them, e.g. deciding on the interfacing
between a highly specific window and an abstract wall, requires
attention to detail. On the positive side, one can use such connections
to guide decision making, e.g. restrict the choice of wall type to those
that match the expectations from the window.

Symbolic representations have considerable capacities for bottom-up
grouping on the basis of explicit relations between symbols, ranging
from similarity (e.g. all vowels in a text) to proximity (all letters in
a word). As is typical of digital symbolic representations, BIM allows
for various groupings of symbols, e.g. the set of all instances of the
same door type in a design, all spaces with a particular use on the
second floor or the parts of a design that belong to the north wing. For
the latter, some additional user input may be required, such as a shape
that represents the outline of the north wing or the labelling of every
symbol with an additional wing property. No user input is required for
relations built into the behavioural constraints of a symbol, e.g. the
hosting of openings in walls.

Through the combination of standard symbol features (like their
properties) and ad hoc, user-defined criteria (like the outline of a
wing), one can process the representation at any relevant abstraction
level and from multiple perspectives, always in direct reference to
specific symbols. For example, it is possible to consider a specific
beam in the context of its local function and connections to other
elements but simultaneously with respect to the whole load-bearing
structure in a single floor or the whole building. Any decision taken
locally, specifically for this beam, relates transparently to either the
instance or the type and may therefore lead not only to changes in the
particular beam but also reconsideration of the beam types comprising
the structure, e.g. a change of type for all similar beams. Reversely,
any decision concerning the general type of the structure can be
directly and automatically propagated to all of its members and their
arrangement.

The automatic propagation of decisions relates to parametric modelling:
the interconnection of symbol properties so that any modification to one
symbol causes others to adapt accordingly (see Appendix II). In addition
to what is built into the relations between types and instances or in
behaviours like hosting, one can explicitly link instance properties,
e.g. make several walls remain parallel to each other or vertical to
another wall. One can also specify that the length of several walls is
the same or a multiple of an explicitly defined parameter. Changing the
value of the parameter leads to automatic modification of the length of
all related walls. Parametric design holds significant promise. People
have envisaged building representations in which it suffices to change a
few values to produce a completely new design. However, establishing and
maintaining the constraint propagation networks necessary for doing so
in a reliable manner remains a major challenge. For the moment,
parametric modelling is a clever way of grouping symbols with explicit
reference to a relation underlying the grouping, e.g. parallelism of
walls. Still, even in such simple cases, the effects of parametric
relations in combination with built-in behaviours can lead to
unpredictable or undesirable results.

In views that replicate conventional drawings, BIM software often also
incorporates visual abstraction that mimics that of scales in analogue
representations. By selecting e.g. “1:20” and “fine” one can make the
visual display of a floor plan more detailed than with “1:200” and
“coarse” (Figure 5). Such settings are useful only for visual
inspection; they alter only the appearance of symbols, not their type or
structure.

The LoD (standard on the specificity of information in a model) is also
related to abstraction. Adherence to LoD standards in a representation
is a throwback to analogue standards regarding drawing scale and stage,
which runs contrary to the integration and compression of stages
advocated by BIM theory. LoD standardization often fails to appreciate
that information in a model has a reason and a purpose: some people have
taken decisions concerning some part or aspect of a design. The
specificity of these decisions and of the resulting representations is
not accidental or conventional. Rather, it reflects what is needed for
that part or aspect at the particular stage of a project. The LoD of the
model that accommodates this information can only be variable, as not
all parts or aspects receive the same attention at any stage.

Specificity should therefore be driven by the need for information
rather than by convention. If information in a representation is at a
higher specificity level, one should not discard it but simply abstract
in a meaningful way by focusing on relevant properties, relations or
symbols. A useful analogy is with how human vision works: in your
peripheral vision, you perceive vague forms and movement, e.g. something
approaching you rapidly. If you turn your eyes and pay attention to
these forms, you can see their details and recognize e.g. a friend
rushing to meet you. As soon as you focus on these forms, other parts of
what you perceive become vague and schematic. In other words, the world
is as detailed as it is; your visual system is what makes some of its
parts more abstract or specific, depending on your needs. By the same
token, the specificity of a building representation should be as high as
the available information allows. Our need for information determines
the abstraction level at which we consider the representation, as well
as actions by which we can increase the specificity of some of its
parts.

* Implementation mechanisms in BIM
Despite its symbolic structure, BIM appears to use the same
implementation mechanisms as CAD: the same geometric primitives that
reproduce the graphic, isomorphic appearance of analogue
representations. The key difference is that these primitives are just
part of pictorial views, in which they express certain symbol
properties. The type of a door, for example, is explicitly named, so
that we do not have to infer its swing from the arc used to represent it
in a floor plan; the width of a wall is a numerical property of its
symbol, so that we do not have to measure the distance between the two
lines indicating the outer faces of the wall. On the contrary, this
distance is determined by the width property of the symbol. These and
other properties are explicit in the model database, making the Unicode
symbols in it and their bits and bytes the true implementation
mechanisms of BIM. Unfortunately, as this database remains largely
hidden from view, users may fail to appreciate its significance.

The above covers the paradigmatic dimension, allowing us to consider any
graphic primitive in a drawing view a mere product of real symbols. As
we have seen, however, implementation mechanisms used in the syntagmatic
dimension still influence the structure of a building representation in
other respects: a wall is still partly determined by drawing its axis
and so by the geometric shape one draws, as well as by dependencies
between this shape to others in the model or view. On the whole,
therefore, one should consider BIM largely immune to undue influences
from graphic implementation mechanisms but at the same time remain aware
of persistent geometric biases both in how BIM treats building
representations and in the mindset of BIM users.

* Models as graphs
Being symbolic representations, models in BIM can be described by graphs
that express their structure in terms of symbols and their relations.
These graphs are similar but not the same as the building, adjacency or
access graphs discussed in a previous chapter: those are graphs that
describe the design rather than the representation. In the graphs that
describe a BIM model, symbols are usually represented by vertices and
relations between symbols by edges (Figure 6 & 7). The edges often make
explicit what is implicit in the model, for example, that each window or
door is hosted by a particular wall and that walls connect to each other
in a specific manner, e.g. co-terminate at the ends.

 

#+caption: /Figure 6. Floor plan of a model in BIM, comprising four
walls, a door and a window/
[[file:media/assets/single_room-e1640780285935.png]]

 

#+caption: /Figure 7. Graph of symbols in Figure 6/
[[file:media/assets/single_room_symbol_graph.png]]

 

The graph summarizes the basic structure of the model: the entities it
comprises and their basic relations, including dependencies, e.g.
between the shape and size of the room and the configuration of walls
that bound it. These relations and their constraints underlie many
behaviours in BIM, for example, that doors and windows tend to stick to
the hosting walls and that walls try to retain their end-connections.

From an information perspective, this becomes even more interesting if
we zoom in on the properties of the symbols and see how they are
affected by relations and constraints, as in the case of a window and
the wall that hosts it (Figure 8). Both elements are represented by
discrete symbols, each with its own set of properties. The hosting
relation means that some of the properties of the wall are inherited by
the window. For example, the orientation of the window is by definition
the same as the orientation of the wall. This constrains the behaviour
of the window symbol when the user positions it in the model or modifies
either the window or the wall.

 

#+caption: /Figure 8. Graph of a window and the wall that hosts it in a
model/
[[file:media/assets/window_wall.png]]

 

Describing such dependencies is especially important for relations that
may be missing from the orthographic views and modelling workflows of
BIM software, for example between walls and floors (Figure 9). The
vertical dimensions of walls are usually determined by a combination of
wall symbol properties and constraints, model setup (levels) and the
presence of symbols like floors to which the top or base of a wall can
attach. Users have to manipulate the wall and floor dimensions and
relations in multiple views, which can be summarized in this rather
simple graph that affords the overview necessary for IM.

 

#+caption: /Figure 9. Graph of a wall and its relations to floors/
[[file:media/assets/wall_floors.png]]

 

Such graphs also reveal other relations that determine the compatibility
of symbols in a relation (a type of parameterization that remains
neglected). Wall and window width, for example, must be such that there
is a technical solution for inserting the wall in the window: the width
of a wall constraints the acceptability of window types. The same
applies to length and height: assuming that the window comes in a
standard size, the wall should be longer and higher (or at least equal)
in order to accommodate it. The example seems trivial but dimensional
incompatibilities of this kind are common in walls that combine multiple
openings and different components.

Understanding the building representation in terms of symbols, relations
and constraints is key to both parameterization and decision making.
Therefore, it becomes a main task for IM. In addition to using graphs to
describe the structure of a model, the model should be set up in a way
that transparently expresses all dependencies and safeguards them
effectively and consistently in all workflows. This concerns relations
between symbols in the representation, as well as with external
constraints, such as planning regulations, building codes and briefs.
For example, modellers should make explicit the maximum height allowed
by the planning regulations for a particular design and connect it to
the relevant symbols and properties, e.g. the position of the roof. By
doing this at the onset of a design project, they ensure that designers
are aware of the constraints within which they work, e.g. that they are
not allowed to place roofs or other elements higher than permitted. As
will be discussed in following chapters, such /feedforward/ that guides
design is preferable to /feedback/, i.e. allowing designers to generate
solutions that are then tested according to regulations they may have
not taken into account.

The previous parts have presented the tandem of digitization and
information, and explained the structure of representations, in
particular of the symbolic ones that populate digital environments. Now
we move to the content of these representations: the data and
information they accommodate. The combination of structure and content
is the foundation of building information management. It sounds
straightforward but is plagued by inadequate definitions and outdated
approaches that keep information management vague, labour-intensive and
inefficient. Consequently, the main goal of this part is to separate the
wheat from the chaff and establish principles for effective, operational
approaches to building information.

* Data and information
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/What constitutes data and information is a fundamental question that
attracts much interest and invites numerous definitions. This chapter
introduces definitions suitable to the symbolic representations
discussed in the previous part, towards a transparent basis for
information management. /

* Theories and definitions
There is nothing more practical than a good theory: it supplies the
definitions people need in order to agree what to do, how and why; it
explains the world, providing new perspectives from which we can view
and understand it; it establishes targets for researchers keen to
improve or refute the theory and so advance science and knowledge. In
our case, there is a clear need for good, transparent and operational
definitions. Terms like ‘information' and ‘data' are used too loosely,
interchangeably and variably to remove ambiguities in information
processing and management. Management, computing and related disciplines
abound with rather too easy, relational definitions of data,
information, knowledge, strategy etc., e.g. that data interpreted become
information, information understood turns into knowledge and so forth.
Such definitions tend to underestimate the complexity of cognitive
processes and are therefore not to be trusted. Even methodically sound
studies, involving large numbers of leading scholars, can do little to
elucidate the meaning and usage of these
terms.[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-1][^{[1]}]]
Arguably, asking for succinct, all-encompassing definitions abstracts
the context from which the definitions derive and renders them too
axiomatic or too vague.

A theory that resolves these problems cannot draw from the AECO domains
only. It needs a firm foundation in general theories of information,
especially those that take the potential and peculiarities of digital
means into account. Thankfully, there are enough candidates for this.

* Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories
When one thinks of information theory in a computing context, Shannon's
MTC springs to
mind.[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-2][^{[2]}]]
The MTC is indeed foundational and preeminent among formal theories of
information. It addresses what has been visualized as the innermost
circle in information theory (Figure
1):[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-3][^{[3]}]]
the syntactic core of information, dealing with the structure and basic,
essential aspects of information, including matters of probability,
transmission flows and capacities of communication facilities --- the
subjects of the technical side of information theory.

The outermost circle in the same visualization is occupied by
pragmatics: real-life usage of meaningful information. IM theories
(discussed in the next chapter) populate this circle, providing a
general operational framework for supporting and controlling information
quality and flow. To apply this framework, one requires pragmatic
constraints and priorities from application areas. For example, a notary
and a facility manager have different interests with regard to the same
building information.

Between the syntactic and the pragmatic lies the intermediate circle of
semantics, which deals with how meaning is added to the syntactical
components of information before they are utilized in real life. As
syntactic approaches are of limited help with the content of information
and its interpretation, establishing a basis for IM requires that we
turn to semantic theories of information.

Arguably the most appealing of these is by Luciano Floridi, who is
credited with establishing the subject of philosophy of information. The
value of his theory goes beyond his position as a modern authority on
the subject. The central role of semantics in his work is an essential
contribution to the development of much-needed theoretical principles in
a world inundated with rapidly changing digital technologies. In our
case, it promises a clear and coherent basis for understanding AECO
information and establishing parsimonious structures that link different
kinds of information and data. These structures simplify IM in a
meaningful and relevant manner: they allow us to shift attention from
/how/ one should manage information (the technical and operational
sides) to /which/ information and /why./

\\
In this book, we focus on data, information and their relation in the
operational context of digital building representations. Utilization of
information and resulting benefits for individuals, enterprises,
disciplines or societies are subjects that require extensive analyses
well beyond the scope of the present book. Information certainly
contributes to achieving these benefits; in many cases it may even be a
prerequisite but seldom suffices by itself. Rather than making unfounded
claims about knowledge and performance, we focus on more modest goals
concerning IM: understanding building information, its quality and
flows, and organizing them in ways that may help AECO take informed
decisions, in the hope that informed also means better.

* A semantic theory for building information
** Data and information instances
A fundamental definition in Floridi's
theory[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-4][^{[4]}]]
concerns the relation between data and information: an instance of
information consists of one or more data which are well-formed and
meaningful. Data are defined as lacks of uniformity in what we perceive
at a given moment or between different states of a percept or between
two symbols in a percept. For example, if a coffee stain appears on a
floor plan drawing on paper (Figure 3), this is certainly a lack of
uniformity with the previous, pristine state of the drawing (Figure 2)
but it is neither well-formed nor meaningful within the context of
architectural representations. It tells us nothing about the
representation or the represented design, except that someone has been
rather careless with the drawing (the physical carrier of the
representation).

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Floor plan/
[[file:media/assets/Floor-plan.jpg]]

 

#+caption: /Figure 3. A new state of the floor plan: the coffee stain is
neither well-formed nor meaningful in the framework of a line drawing/
[[file:media/assets/Floor-plan-with-stain.jpg]]

 

On the other hand, if the lack of uniformity between the two states is a
new straight line segment across a room in a floor plan (Figure 4), this
is both well-formed (as a line in a line drawing) and meaningful
(indicating a change in the design, possibly that the room has now a
split-level floor).

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. A different new state of the floor plan: the line
segment is both well-formed and meaningful/
[[file:media/assets/Floor-plan-with-line.jpeg]]

 

** Data and information types
The typology of data is a key component in Floridi's approach. Data can
be:

- /Primary/, like the name and birth date of a person in a database, or
  the light emitted by an indicator lamp to show that a radio receiver
  is on.
- /Anti--data,/[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-5][^{[5]}]]
  i.e. the absence of primary data, like the failure of an indicator
  lamp to emit light or silence following having turned the radio on.
  Anti-data are informative: they tell us that e.g. the radio or the
  indicator lamp are defective.
- /Derivative:/ data produced by other, typically primary data, which
  can therefore serve as indirect indications of the primary ones, such
  as a series of transactions with a particular credit card as an
  indication of the trail of its owner.
- /Operational/: data about the operations of the whole system, like a
  lamp that indicates whether other indicator lamps are malfunctioning.
- /Metadata/: indications about the nature of the information system,
  like the geographic coordinates that tell where a digital photograph
  has been taken.

These types also apply to information instances, depending on the type
of data they contain: an information instance containing metadata is
meta-information.

In the context of analogue building representations like floor plans
(Figure 5), lines denoting building elements are primary data. They
describe the shape of these elements, their position and the materials
they comprise.

 

#+caption: /Figure 5. In an analogue floor plan, lines denoting building
elements are primary data/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types-1024x863-1.png]]

 

In addition to geometric primary data, an analogue floor plan may
contain alphanumeric primary data, such as labels indicating the
function of a room or dimension lines (Figure 6). A basic principle in
hand drawing is that such explicitly specified dimensions take
precedence over measurements in the drawing because amending the
dimensions is easier than having to redraw the building elements.

 

#+caption: /Figure 6. Alphanumeric primary data in an analogue floor
plan/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_primary_alphanumeric-1024x863-1.png]]

 

Anti-data are rather tricky to identify in the typically abstract and
elliptical analogue building representations. Quite often it is hard to
know if something is missing. One should therefore consider absence as
anti-data chiefly when absence runs contrary to expectation and is
therefore directly informative: a door missing from the perimeter of a
room indicates either a design mistake or that the room is inaccessible
(e.g. a shaft). Similarly, a missing room label indicates either that
the room has no specific function or that the drawer has forgotten to
include it in the floor plan (Figure 7).

 

#+caption: /Figure 7. Anti-data in an analogue floor plan/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_antidata-1024x863-1.png]]

 

Derivative data in building representations generally refer to the
abundance of measurements, tables and other data produced from primary
data in the representation, such as floor area labels in a floor plan
(Figure 8). One can recognize derivative data from the fact that they
can be omitted from the representation without reducing its completeness
or specificity: derivative data like the area of a room can be easily
reproduced when necessary from primary data (the room dimensions). An
important point is that one should always keep in mind the conventions
of analogue representations, like the precedence of dimension lines over
measurement in the drawing, which turns the former into primary data.

 

#+caption: /Figure 8. Derivative data in an analogue floor plan/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_derivative-1024x863-1.png]]

 

Operational data reveal the structure of the building representation and
explain how data should be interpreted. Examples include graphic scale
bars and north arrows, which indicate respectively the true size of
units measured in the representation and the true orientation of shapes
in the design (Figure 9).

 

#+caption: /Figure 9. Operational data in an analogue floor plan/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_operational-1024x863-1.png]]

 

Finally, metadata describe the nature of the representation, such as the
projection type and the design project or building, e.g. labels like
‘floor plan' (Figure 10).

 

#+caption: /Figure 10. Metadata in an analogue floor plan/

* BIM, information and data
** Data types in BIM
As we have seen in previous chapters, computerization does not just
reproduce analogue building representations. Digital representations may
mimic their analogue counterparts in appearance but can be quite
different in structure. This becomes evident when we examine the data
types they contain. Looking at a BIM editor on a computer screen, one
cannot help observing a striking shift in primary and derivative data
(Figure 11 & 12): most graphic elements in views like floor plans are
derived from properties of symbols. In contrast to analogue drawings,
dimension lines and their values in BIM are derivative, pure annotations
like floor area calculations in a space. This is understandable: the
ease with which one can modify a digital representation renders analogue
practices of refraining from applying changes to a drawing meaningless.

Less intuitive is that even the lines denoting the various materials of
a building element are derivative, determined by the type of the symbol:
if the type of a wall changes, then all these graphic elements change
accordingly. In analogue representations the opposite applies: we infer
the wall type from the graphic elements that describe it in terms of
layers of materials and other components.

 

#+caption: /Figure 11. Primary data in BIM/

  </figure>
#+end_html

 

#+caption: /Figure 12. Derivative data in BIM/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_BIM_derivative-1024x545-1.png]]

 

The main exception to this shift is the geometry of symbols. As
described in the previous chapter, when one enters e.g. a wall in BIM,
the usual workflow is to first choose the type of the wall and then draw
its axis in a geometric view like a floor plan. Similarly, modifications
to the location or shape of the wall are made by changing the same axis,
while other properties, like layer composition and material properties
of each layer, can only be changed in the definition of the wall type.
One can also change the axis by typing new coordinates in some window
but in most BIM editors the usual procedure is interactive modification
of the drawn axis with a pointer device like a mouse. Consequently,
primary data appear dispersed over a number of views and windows,
including ones that chiefly contain derivative data.

One should not be confused by the possibilities offered by computer
programs, especially for the modification of entities in a model. The
interfaces of these programs are rich with facilities for interacting
with shapes and values. It seems as if programmers have taken the
trouble to allow users to utilize practically everything for this
purpose. For example, one may be able to change the length of a wall by
typing a new value for its dimension line, i.e. via derivative data.
Such redundancy of entry points is highly prized in human-computer
interaction but may be confusing for IM, as it tends to obscure the type
of data and the location where each type can be found. To reduce
confusion and hence the risk of mistakes and misunderstandings, one
should consider the character of each view or window and how necessary
it is for defining an entity in a model. A schedule, for example, is
chiefly meant for displaying derivative data, such as area or volume
calculations, but may also contain primary data for reasons of overview,
transparency or legibility. Most schedules are not necessary for
entering entities in a model, in contrast to a window containing the
properties of a symbol, from where one chooses the type of the entity to
be entered. In managing the primary data of a symbol one should
therefore focus on the property window and its contents.

Computer interfaces also include more operational data, through which
users can interact with the software. Part of this interaction concerns
how other data are processed, including in terms of appearance, as with
the scale and resolution settings in drawing views mentioned in the
previous chapter (Figure 13).

 

#+caption: /Figure 13. Operational data in BIM/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_BIM_operational-1024x545-1.png]]

 

The presence of multiple windows on the screen also increases the number
of visible metadata, such as window headers that describe the view in
each window (Figure 14).

 

#+caption: /Figure 14. Metadata in BIM/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_BIM_metadata-1024x545-1.png]]

 

Anti-data remain difficult to distinguish from data missing due to
abstraction or deferment. The lack of values for e.g. cost or fire
rating for some building elements may merely indicate that their
calculation has yet to take place, despite the availability of the
necessary primary data. After all, both are calculated on the basis of
materials present in the elements: if these materials are known, cost
and fire ratings are easy to derive. One should remember this inherent
duality in anti-data: they do not only indicate missing primary data but
the presence of anti-data is significant and meaningful by itself. For
example, not knowing the materials and finishes of a window frame,
although the window symbol is quite detailed, signifies that the
interfacing of the window to a wall is a non-trivial problem that
remains to be solved. Interfacing typically produces anti-data,
especially when sub-models meet in BIM, e.g. when the MEP and
architectural sub-models are integrated, and the fastenings of pipes and
cables to walls are present in neither. Anti-data generally necessitate
action: no value (or “none”) for the demolition phase of an entity
suggests that the entity has to be preserved during all demolition
phases --- not ignored but actively preserved with purposeful measures,
which should be made explicit (Figure 15).

 

#+caption: /Figure 15. Anti-data in BIM/
[[file:media/assets/semantic-data-types_BIM_antidata-1024x545-1.png]]

 

** Information instances in BIM
Knowing the type of data in BIM is a prerequisite identifying
information as it emerges in a model. The next step is to recognize it
in the interfaces of the software. As described in the previous section,
data are to be found in the symbols: their properties and relations. In
the various views and windows of BIM software, one can easily find the
properties of each symbol, either of the instance (Figure 16 & 18) or of
the type (Figure 17). What one sees in most views and windows is a mix
of different data types, with derivative data like a volume calculation
or thermal resistance next to primary data, such as the length and
thickness of a wall. Moreover, no view or window contains a
comprehensive collection of properties. As a result, when a property
changes in one view, the change is reflected in several other parts of
the interface that accommodate the same property or data derived from
it.

 

#+caption: /Figure 16. Instance properties palette in a BIM editor

[[file:media/assets/wall_properties_solibri-1024x459-1.png]]

 

Any lack of uniformity in these properties, including the addition of
new symbols to a model, qualifies as data. One can restrict the
identification of data to each view separately but it makes more sense
for IM to include all clones of the same property, in any view. Any
derivative data that are automatically produced or modified as a result
of the primary data changes count as different data instances. So, any
change in the shape of a space counts as a single data instance,
regardless of the view in which the user applies the change or of in how
many views the change appears. The ensuing change in the space area
value counts as a second instance of data; the change in the space
volume as a third.

Relations between symbols are even more dispersed and often tacit. They
can be found hidden in symbol behaviours (e.g. in that windows, doors or
wash basins tend to stick to walls or in that walls tend to retain their
co-termination), in explicit parametric rules and constraints, as well
as in properties like construction time labels that determine incidental
grouping. Discerning lacks of uniformity in relations is therefore often
hard, especially because most derive variably from changes in the
symbols. For example, modifying the length of a wall may inadvertently
cause its co-termination with another wall to be removed or, if the
co-termination is retained, to change the angle between the walls. Many
relations can be made explicit and controllable through appropriate
views like schedules. As we have seen, window and door schedules make
explicit relations between openings and spaces. This extends to
relations between properties of windows or doors and of the adjacent
spaces, e.g. connects the fire rating of a door to whether a space on
either side is part of a main fire egress route or the acoustic
isolation offered by the door to the noise or privacy level of
activities accommodated in either adjacent space.

Information instances can be categorized by the type of their data:
primary, derivative, operational etc. Type is important for IM because
it allows, firstly, to prioritize in terms of significance and,
secondly, to link information to actors and stakeholders concerning
authorship and custodianship. Primary information obviously carries a
higher priority than derivative. Moreover, primary information (e.g. the
shape of spaces) is produced or maintained by specific actors (e.g.
designers), preferably with no interference by others who work with
information derived from it (e.g. fire engineers). Information instances
concerning space shape are passed on from the designers to the fire
engineers, whose observations or recommendations are fed back to the
designers, who then initiate possible further actions and produce new
data. Understanding these flows, the information types they convey and
transparently linking instances to each other and to actors or
stakeholders is essential for IM.

Another categorization of information instances concerns /scope/. This
leads to two fundamental categories:

1. Instances comprising one or more properties or relations of a single
   symbol: the data are produced when one enters the symbol in the
   representation or when the symbol is modified, either interactively
   by a user or automatically, e.g. on the basis of a built-in
   behaviour, parametric rule etc. Instances of this category are basic
   and homogeneous: they refer to a single entity of a particular kind,
   e.g. a door. The entity can be:
   1. Generic in type, like an abstract internal door
   2. Contextually specific, such as a door for a particular wall in the
      design, i.e. partially defined by relations in the representation
   3. Specific in type, e.g. a specific model of a particular
      manufacturer, fixed in all its properties
2. Instances comprising one or more properties or relations of multiple
   symbols, added or modified together, e.g. following a change of type
   for a number of internal walls, or a resizing of the building
   elements bounding a particular space. Consequently, instances of this
   category can be:
   1. Homogeneous, comprising symbols of the same type, e.g. all office
      spaces in a building
   2. Heterogeneous, comprising symbols of various types, usually
      related to each other in direct, contextual ways, e.g. the spaces
      and doors of a particular wing that make up a fire egress route

These categories account for all data and abstraction levels in a
representation, from sub-symbols (like the modification of the geometry
of a door handle in the definition of a door type) to changes in the
height of a floor level that affects the location of all building
elements and spaces on that floor, the size and composition of some
(e.g. stairs) and potentially also relations to entities on adjacent
floors. Understanding the scope of information is essential for IM: it
determines the extent to which any information instance or change should
be propagated to ensure consistency and coherence.

* Symbols and their properties in context
So far we have considered the semantic data types of symbol properties
in isolation, as if each symbol were a separate entity rather than
incorporated in a representation. However, in the symbol graphs
discussed in a previous chapter, we have seen that relations in a model
profoundly affect the properties of each symbol. Parameterization adds
to the number and complexity of such relations but even without
parameterization there are many primary properties that become
derivative in the context of a representation due to common, often
implicit relations.

In the example of a window and the wall that hosts it, some properties
of the window, such as orientation, are inherited from the corresponding
properties of the hosting element (Figure 19). These relations therefore
affect the semantic data type of symbol properties. Both the window and
the wall in this example are each represented by a discrete symbol with
its own properties. Most of these properties are primary data, i.e.
essential for the identity of each symbol: length, height, width,
material composition etc. BIM software routinely also adds properties
that are derivative, i.e. products of functions on primary properties,
such as area and volume but also fire rating and cost. Orientation is
another derivative property that in a straight wall can be calculated
from the relative position of the endpoints of the wall axis. This
calculation applies to the wall but is not required for the window,
which by definition inherits orientation from the wall, as does any
other hosted element. One could argue that other properties of the
window, notably its dimensions, remain primary in spite of the hosting
relation but the fact that their values must be in a range determined by
the wall properties also makes them derivative, only not in the strict
sense of equality that applies to orientation. They remain the same as
in the unattached window so long as they do not cause any interfacing
problems with the wall but, when this happens, it becomes clear that the
width of the window is linked to that of the hosting wall.

 

#+caption: /Figure 19. Relations between window and hosting wall/
[[file:media/assets/window_wall.png]]

 

Similar derivation of dimensions on the basis of relations also applies
to non-hosted elements. For example, the height of a wall is normally
constrained by the position of the floor above and the floor underneath
the wall: the wall height is derived from difference in vertical level
between the two floors that bound it (Figure 20).

 

#+caption: /Figure 20. Symbol graph of the wall and the two floors that
bound it/
[[file:media/assets/wall_floors.png]]

 

This relation seems straightforward but BIM software makes it more
complicated in a way that reveals the intricate chain behind any
relation we isolate by way of example. A wall in BIM may be constrained
not by floor symbols but by /levels:/ reference planes in the model
setup. The wall in Figure 21 has its base on Level 1 (which also
determines the position of a floor symbol) but its top is determined by
a default value of the type, as indicated in the properties palette. The
wall appears to connect to the floor underneath it but in fact the
position of both is determined by the same level.

 

#+caption: /Figure 21. Wall partly constrained by levels/
[[file:media/assets/wall-top-by-default.png]]

 

On the other hand, the top of the wall in Figure 22 is determined by
Level 2, which also constrains the position of another floor symbol. As
the properties palette reveals, this wall is moreover attached at the
top. This means that if the floor above the wall is moved to another
height, the wall tries to remain connected to it. If the floor below is
moved, the wall sticks to the level, losing contact with the floor. If
the base was also attached, then the wall would be fully constrained, as
in Figure 20.

 

#+caption: /Figure 22. Wall fully constrained by levels and attached at
the base/
[[file:media/assets/wall-top-constrained.png]]

 

The above examples demonstrate that the semantic type of each property
is often affected by constraints external to the symbols. The width of a
wall, for instance, can be determined by its composition out of various
layers of different materials, each with its own thickness. This makes
wall width derivative and creates some dimensional and technical
tolerances, as e.g. a wall can be made thinner by replacing an
insulation layer with thinner, better material, without changing the
wall's thermal performance. On the other hand, wall width can also be
fixed by external constraints, e.g. for reasons of standardization. This
makes wall width primary, while the material composition of the wall
(the material layers and their thickness) becomes derivative from the
fixed wall width and requirements on e.g. thermal or acoustic
performance.

Some of the most important external constraints come from planning
regulations. These often determine large parts of a design, e.g. the
position of external walls by a setback from the plot boundaries. This
means that the footprint of the building is derived from the plot shape
and dimensions minus the setbacks. Similarly, most Dutch planning
regulations impose a setback from the ends of the roof for dormer
windows, e.g. 100 cm from the bottom and side ends, and 50 cm from the
top (Figure 23). Consequently, the dimensions of the dormer are derived
from those of the roof, which in turn derive from the building
footprint, and external constraints, including on the roof pitch (also
determined by planning regulations, either by a fixed value, such as 30
degrees, or a bandwidth, e.g. 25--40 degrees). In short, a building
representation is based on such networks of relations and constraints,
making many primary properties dependent on others and therefore
derivative.

The conclusions that can be drawn from the above are:

1. The semantic type is sensitive to the context: what in an isolated
   symbol is a primary property may become derivative in a
   representation where the symbol connects to others.
2. These others include symbols in the same representation, as well as
   external information entities, such as constraints from standards or
   planning regulations. For IM purposes, these too should be explicitly
   included in the representation.

 

*** Key Takeaways
- /A information instance consists of one or more data which are
  well-formed and meaningful/
- /Data are lacks of uniformity in what we perceive at a given moment or
  between different states of a percept or between two symbols in a
  percept/
- /Data can be primary, anti-data, derivative, operational or metadata/
- /There are significant differences between analogue and digital
  building representations concerning data types, with symbols like
  dimension lines being primary in the one and derivative in the other/
- /In BIM, lacks of uniformity can be identified in the properties and
  relations of symbols/
- /Information instances can be categorized by the semantic type of
  their data and by their scope in the representation/
- /Semantic type depends on the context, which may turn primary data
  into derivative/

*** Exercises
1. Identify the semantic data types in the infobox of a Wikipedia
   biographic lemma (the summary panel on the top right), e.g.
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_van_Eyck][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_van_Eyck]]
   (Figure
   19),[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-6][^{[6]}]]
   and in the basic page information of the same lemma (e.g.
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aldo_van_Eyck&action=info][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aldo_van_Eyck&action=info]])
2. Explain the information instances produced in BIM when one inserts a
   door in an existing wall. Use the following notation:\\
   /(scope; symbol; name of property or relation; value of property or
   relation; time; semantic data type)\\
   /If the instances concern multiple symbols, use the notation to
   describe each symbol separately.
3. Explain the information instances produced in BIM when one moves an
   existing door to a slightly different position in an existing wall.
   Use the above notation for each concerned symbol separately.
4. In BIM it is claimed that one can add information dimensions to the
   three geometric dimensions, turning 3D into /n/D: 4D comes with the
   addition of time (e.g. when the symbolized entity is constructed), 5D
   with the addition of cost, 6D with sustainability, 7D with facility
   management, 8D with accident prevention (or safety) etc. However, for
   something to qualify as a dimension, it should be primary and not
   derivative, otherwise area and volume would be dimensions,
   too.[[#chapter-006-data-and-information.xhtml#footnote-109-7][^{[7]}]]\\
   Describe how the values of these four dimensions emerge and change
   throughout the lifecycle of a building element or component, such as
   a door, window, floor, ceiling etc., and which primary or derivative
   information attracts attention in various stages and activities after
   development (procurement, transport, realization, maintenance,
   refurbishment, renovation, demolition etc.). Present your results in
   a table.
5. IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is a standard underlying BIM, in
   particular concerning how each entity is represented. Identify the
   semantic data types in the IFC wall base quantities, i.e. quantities
   that are common to the definition of all occurrences of walls
   ([[https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/DEV/IFC4_3/RC2/HTML/schema/ifcsharedbldgelements/qset/qto_wallbasequantities.htm][http://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc/dev/IFC4_3/RC2/html/schema/ifcsharedbldgelements/qset/qto_wallbasequantities.htm]]).
   Pay particular attention to derivative quantities present in the
   specification. If each of the quantities becomes a symbol property in
   BIM, calculate how much of a typical model consists of derivative
   data, both in percentage and megabytes (assuming that what holds for
   walls also holds for all entities in BIM).

* Information management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/This chapter introduces the general goals of information management and
connects them to building representations, semantic types and AECO
processes in order to distill the main goals of building information
management./

* The need for information management
With the information explosion we have been experiencing, it is hardly
surprising that IM seems to have become a self-evident technical
necessity. Handling the astounding amounts of information produced and
disseminated every day requires more robust and efficient approaches
than ever. Nevertheless, IM is considered mostly as a means to an end,
usually performance in a project or enterprise: with effective IM, one
can improve the chances of higher performance. Consequently, IM usually
forms a key component of overall management.

This is widely acknowledged in building design management (DM). Even
before the digital era, the evident dependence of AECO on information
that came from various sources and concerned different but
interconnected aspects of a building had led to general agreement that
this information and the way it is handled can be critical for
communication and decision making. DM often focuses on information
completeness, relevance, clarity, accuracy, quality, value, timeliness
etc., as prerequisites to enabling greater productivity, improving risk
management, reducing errors and generally raising efficiency and
reliability. The dependence on information is such that some even go so
far as to suggest that DM is really fundamentally about IM: managing
information flows so that stakeholders receive the right information at
the right
time.[[#chapter-007-information-management.xhtml#footnote-48-1][^{[1]}]]

In practical terms, however, there is little clarity concerning what
should be managed and how. DM sources often merely affirm that
information is important and should be treated with care. What makes
information usable, valuable, relevant etc. is assumed to be known
tacitly. Information is vaguely defined as data in usable form but is
also equated to the thousands of drawings and other documents produced
during the lifecycle of a building --- the carriers of information. If
the right document is present, then it is assumed that stakeholders also
possess the right information and are directly capable of judging the
veracity, completeness, coherence etc. of what they receive. However,
equating information with documents not only prolongs outdated analogue
practices, it also places a heavy burden on users.

It is arguably typical of AECO and DM that, in the face of operational
and especially technical complexity, they invest heavily in human
resources. This goes beyond the interpretation of documents in order to
extract information; it also extends to the invention of new roles that
assume a mix of new and old tasks and responsibilities. So, in addition
to project and process managers, one encounters information managers as
well as BIM managers and CAD managers, BIM coordinators and CAD
coordinators, working together in complex, overlapping hierarchies.
These new roles are usually justified by the need for support with new
technologies, which may be yet unfamiliar to the usual participants in
an AECO project. This, however, increases the distance between new
technologies and their real users, limiting learning opportunities and
prolonging the treatment of technologies as new and unfamiliar
(something that contrasts sharply with what we do in our private
encounters with new technologies, as discussed in the section on
digitization). Even worse, all these roles increase complexity and
reduce transparency by adding more intermediaries in the already
multi-layered structure of AECO.

New roles are inevitable with technological innovation. Sometimes they
are temporary and sometimes permanent. In the early days of motorcars,
for example, chauffeurs were more widely employed to drive them than
today. On the other hand, webmasters have become necessary by the
invention and popularity of the World Wide Web and remain so for the
foreseeable future, despite the growing web literacy among general
users. What matters is that any such new roles should be part of a sound
and thorough plan of approach rather than an easy alternative to a good
approach. A good plan should determine what is needed and why, allowing
for increasing familiarity and even proficiency of many users with
various technologies, to a degree that, after some point, they might
require little day-to-day support. In our case, one may safely expect
that AECO professionals will eventually become quite capable not only of
using BIM directly but also of coordinating their BIM activities, with
little need for technical intermediaries. To achieve this, AECO needs
practical familiarization with the new technologies but above all clear
comprehension of what these technologies do with information. Based on
that, one can develop a sound IM approach that takes into consideration
both domain needs and the capacities of digital technologies in order to
determine changes in the tasks, responsibilities and procedures of
existing AECO roles, and develop profiles for any additional roles.

* Information sources
** Inclusiveness
IM is both an activity and a well-defined discipline of professionals
who support this activity. The discipline of IM has a broad scope and,
as a result, is quite
inclusive.[[#chapter-007-information-management.xhtml#footnote-48-2][^{[2]}]]
It pays no attention to issues of representation and accepts as
information sources all kinds of documents, applications, services and
schemes. This is due to three reasons. Firstly, IM covers many
application areas and must therefore be adaptable to practices
encountered in any of them. Secondly, in many areas there is a mix of
analogue and digital information, as well as various channels. For
example, financial client transactions with a shop can involve cash and
debit or credit cards, either physically or via the web. IM provides
tools for bringing such disparate material together into more coherent
forms, ensuring that no outdated or inappropriate information is used
and preventing that information is missing, inaccessible or deleted by
error. These tools include correlation with contexts (e.g. time series
displays relative to other data), classification and condensation
(aggregation, totalling, filtering and summarization). Thirdly, IM has a
tenuous relation to computerization, often relying on it but also
appearing weary of putting too much emphasis on digital technologies as
a general solution.

The inclusiveness of IM with respect to information sources means that
it may end up not only tolerating the redundancy of analogue and digital
versions of the same information but also supporting outdated practices
and conventions, even prolonging their life through superficial
digitization, on the assumption that the application area wants it. This
reduces IM to mere document management, i.e. making sure that the
necessary documents are retained and kept available. Such inclusiveness
is arguably an easy way out of most domain problems. At present, there
may be enough computer power and capacity to store and retrieve any
document produced in a project or enterprise --- in our case, throughout
the whole lifecycle of a building. However, the information explosion of
the digital era and big data approaches suggest the opposite: we already
need more intelligent solutions than brute force. Can we upscale the
haphazard, inclusive recording of the history of a building to all
buildings in the world? At this moment, we may have the illusion that we
still have control over the huge amounts of information in production
and circulation but this is because AECO currently approaches
information with respect to the limited demands of normative practices.
Beyond these demands, there is already too much information that is
ignored, neglected and even discarded. Moreover, new developments like
the IoT could change the overall picture soon, as smart things start
communicating with each other with great intensity. For AECO this can be
quite critical because buildings are among the prime candidates for
accommodating a wide range of sensors and actuators, e.g. for
controlling energy consumption, ensuring security or regulating air
quality to prevent the spread of epidemics.

** Structured, semi-structured and unstructured information
BIM is important for IM because it marks a transition not only to
symbolic representation but also to holistic, /structured/ information
solutions for AECO. With regard to structure, there are three main data
categories:

- /Unstructured data/ are the subject of big data approaches: sensor
  measurements, social media messages and other data without a uniform,
  standardized format. Finding relevant information in unstructured data
  is quite demanding because queries have to take into account a broad
  range of locations where meaningful data may reside and a wide variety
  of storage forms (including natural language and images).
- /Semi-structured data/ are a favourite of IM: information sources with
  a loosely defined structure and flexible use. Analogue drawings are a
  typical example: one knows what is expected in e.g. a section but
  there are several alternative notations and few if any prohibitions
  concerning what may be depicted and how. IM thrives on semi-structured
  sources, adding metadata, extracting and condensing, so as to
  summarize relevant information into a structured overview.
- /Structured data/ are found in sources where one knows precisely what
  is expected and where. Databases are prime examples of structured
  information sources. In a relational database, one knows that each
  table describes a particular class of entities, that each record in a
  table describes a single entity and that each field describes a
  particular property of these entities in the same, predefined way.
  Finding the right data in a structured source is therefore
  straightforward and less challenging for IM.

In contrast to analogue drawings, BIM is clearly structured, along the
lines of a database. Each symbol belongs to a particular type and has
specific properties. This structure is one of the driving forces behind
BIM, in particular with respect to its capacity to integrate and process
building information coherently. Given the effort put into developing
structured models in BIM, it makes little sense to abandon the
advantages they promise. This makes BIM the main environment for IM in
AECO and calls for approaches that should:

- /Avoid having other primary information sources next to BIM./ All
  building information should be integrated in BIM and any related data
  linked to it. Currently, there is general agreement that the price of
  a component, e.g. a washbasin, should be a property of the
  corresponding symbol. However, the same should apply to all data
  relevant to AECO, e.g. packaging information for this component. The
  dimensions of the box in which the washbasin is brought to the
  building site, the packaging materials it contains etc. are useful for
  logistic purposes, as well as for waste management. Trying to retrieve
  this information from the manufacturer's catalogue is significantly
  less efficient than integrating the relevant data among the symbol
  properties. The same applies to a photograph of some part of the
  building during construction or use. This too should be connected to
  BIM as a link between the digital file of the photograph and relevant
  symbols in the model (Figure 1) or even mapped as a decal on the
  symbols (Figure 2).
- /Desist from promoting BIM output to the level of a primary source./
  Any view of a model, from a floor plan to a cost calculation, can be
  exported as a separate document (PDF, spreadsheet etc.). Such an
  export may have its practical uses but one should not treat it as a
  source separate from the model. Any query about the building should
  start from the model, bypassing exports and similar output. Using IM
  to ensure consistency between exports and the model is meaningless.
  This applies even to legally significant documents like contracts
  because these too can be expressed as views of the model (i.e. textual
  frames around data exported from the model).

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. Photograph of current state linked as image to
relevant components in Revit/
[[file:media/assets/associated-image_capture.png]]

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Photograph of current state mapped as decal in
Revit/
[[file:media/assets/decal_captured.png]]

 

From the above, a wider information environment emerges around the
model, populated largely by data linked to the model, preferably to
specific symbols. IM can assist with the organization of this
environment but it should not be allowed to cut corners, e.g. answer
queries on the basis of satellite files. IM reliability depends on
transparent links between queries, external files and the model,
specifically the primary data in symbols and their history.

It is perhaps ironic that while the world is focusing on big,
unstructured data, AECO should insist on structured data. One
explanation is latency: AECO has been late with the development of
structured information solutions because it continued to use analogue,
semi-structured practices in digital facsimiles. As a consequence, AECO
has yet to reap the benefits of structured data approaches, let alone
find their limits.

The emphasis on the structured nature of BIM also flies in the face of
IM and its inclusiveness. In this respect, one should keep in mind what
was discussed in a previous section: IM is a means, not an end, and its
adaptability has historical causes. It is not compulsory to retain
redundant information sources next to BIM, simply because IM can handle
redundancy and complexity. If the structured content of BIM suffices,
then IM for AECO simply becomes easier and parsimonious.

* Information management goals
** Information flow
What we should learn from IM is that the treatment of information should
have clear goals. The first of the two main goals of IM is to regulate
information flows. This is usually achieved by specifying precise
processing steps and stages, which ensure that information is produced
and disseminated on time and to the right people, until it is finally
archived (or disposed of). In terms of the semantic information theory
underlying our approach, this involves identifying and tracking
information instances throughout a process, covering both the production
and modification of data. IM puts emphasis on the sources and stores of
information: the containers from which information is drawn, in which it
rests or is archived. BIM combines all these into a single information
environment, shifting attention to the symbols, their properties and
relations, where all data are found.

Managing information flow involves:

- /What:/ the information required for or returned by each specific task
  in a process
- /Who:/ the actors or stakeholders who produce or receive the
  information in a task
- /How:/ the processing of information instances
- /When:/ the timing of information instances

/What/ is about the paradigmatic dimension: symbols in BIM and external
sources linked to them. For both internal and external information, it
is critical to distinguish between /authorship/ and /custodianship/: the
actors who produce some information are not necessarily the same
stakeholders who safeguard this information in a project, let alone in
the lifecycle of a building. A typical example is the brief: this is
usually compiled in the initiative stage by a specialist on the basis of
client and user input, as well as professional knowledge. In the
development stage, custodianship often passes on to a project manager
who utilizes the information in the brief to guide and evaluate the
design, possibly also adapting the brief on the basis of insights from
the design. Then in the use stage, it becomes background to facility and
property management, before it develops into a direct or indirect source
for a new brief, e.g. for the refurbishment of the building. Making
custodianship specific and unambiguous in all stages is of paramount
importance in an integrated environment like BIM, where overlaps and
grey areas are easy to develop.

/How/ information flows are regulated relates to the syntagmatic
dimension of a model: the sequence of actions through which symbols,
their properties and relations are processed. The information instances
produced by these actions generally correspond to the sequence of tasks
in the process but are also subject to extrinsic constraints, including
from the software (the implementation environment): the presence of
bounding walls is necessary for defining a space in most BIM editors,
although in many design processes one starts with the spatial design
rather than with construction. IM needs to take such conflicts into
account and differentiate between the two sequences.

A useful device for translating tasks into information actions is the
tripartite scheme /Input-Processing-Output (I‑P‑O)/ that underlies any
form of information processing. For any task, some actors deliver
information as input. This input is then processed by other (or even the
same) actors, who return as output some other information. Then, this
output usually becomes input for the next task. IM has to ensure that
the right input is delivered to the right actors and that the right
output is collected. By considering each decision task with respect to
I‑P‑O, one can identify missing information in the input and arrange for
its delivery.

The syntagmatic dimension obviously also relates to /when:/ the moments
when information instances become available. These moments usually form
a coherent time schedule. The time schedule captures the sequence of
actions and transactions, linking each to specific information
instances. Here again one should differentiate between the sequence of
tasks, which tends to be adequately covered by a project schedule, and
the sequence of information actions, which may require additional
refinement. This difference is the subject of the next part in this
book.

** Information flow in BIM
We are used to viewing the early part of a design process as something
almost magical: someone puts a few lines on a scrap of paper and
suddenly we have a basis for imagining what the building will look like.
The same applies to BIM: one starts entering symbols in a model and
suddenly the design is there for all to see and process. Building
information flows seem to emerge out of nothing but this is far from
true. The designers who make the first sketches or decide on the first
elements in a model operate on the basis of general knowledge of their
disciplines, more precise knowledge of the kind of building they are
designing and specific project information, including location
characteristics and briefs. In other words, building representations are
the product of cognitive processes that combine both tacit and overt
information.

It is also widely assumed that the amount of information in a design
process grows from very little in early design to substantial amounts by
the end, when a building is fully specified. This actually refers to the
specificity of conventional building representations, e.g. the drawing
scales used in different design stages. In fact, even before the first
sketch is made, there usually is considerable information available on
the building. Some of it predates the project, e.g. planning regulations
and building codes that determine much of the form of a building and key
features of its elements, such as the pitch of the roof and the
dimensions of stairs. Other information belongs to the project, e.g. the
brief that states accommodation requirements for the activities to be
housed in the building, the budget that constrains cost and
location-related principles like the continuation of vistas or
circulation networks through the building site. Early building
representations may conform to such specifications but most related
information remains tacit, either in other documents or in the mind of
the designers. For example, the site layout on which one starts drawing
or modelling rarely includes planning regulations, even though the
designers are normally aware of these regulations and their impact on
the design.

In managing both AECO processes and information, one should ensure that
tacit information becomes explicit and is connected to tasks. In BIM,
this means augmenting the basic model setup (site plan, floor levels,
grids etc.) with constraints from planning regulations (e.g. in the form
of the permissible building envelope), use information from the brief
and constraints on the kind of building elements that are admissible in
the model (e.g. with respect to the fire rating of the building).
Integration of such information amounts to /feedforward:/ measurement
and control of the information system before disturbances occur.
Feedforward is generally more efficient and effective than feedback,
e.g. checking if all building elements meet the fire safety requirements
after they have been entered in the model.

It has also been suggested that early design decisions have a bigger
impact on the outcome of a design process than later decisions. Having
to decide on the basis of little overt information makes these decisions
difficult and precarious. This conventional wisdom concerning early
decisions may be misleading. Admittedly, early design decisions tend to
concern basic features and aspects, from overall form to load-bearing
structure, which determine much of the building and so have a
disproportionate influence on cost and performance. However, such
decisions are not exclusive to early design: the type of load-bearing
structure can change late in the process, e.g. in relation to cost
considerations, procurement or the unanticipated need for larger spans.
Late changes can be even more expensive because they also necessitate
careful control of all interfacing between load-bearing and other
elements in the design. Moreover, small, local decisions can also be
critical, whether in an early or late stage: if some doors in a building
are too narrow, wheelchair circulation may become cumbersome or even
impossible, leading to costly restrictions or adaptations. From an IM
perspective, what matters is that all relevant information is made
explicit in BIM, so as to know which data serve as input for a task and
how to register the output of the task. Explicitness of information
allows us to map decision making in a process and understand the scope
and significance of any decision, regardless of process stage.

** Information quality
The second main goal of IM is to safeguard or improve information
quality.[[#chapter-007-information-management.xhtml#footnote-48-3][^{[3]}]]
Quality matters to IM in two respects. Firstly, for information utility:
information produced and disseminated in a process should meet the
requirements of its users. Secondly, concerning information value:
information with a higher quality needs to be preserved and propagated
with higher priority. IM measures quality pragmatically, in terms of
relevance, i.e. fitness for purpose: how well the information supports
the tasks of its users. In addition to pragmatic information quality, IM
is also keen on inherent information quality: how well the information
reflects the real-world entities it represents. It should be noted that
IM is not passive with regard to information quality. It can also
improve it, both at meta-levels (e.g. by systematically applying tags)
and with respect to content (e.g. through condensation).

In both senses, information quality is determined within each
application domain. IM offers a tactical, operational and technical
framework but does not provide answers to domain questions. These
answers have to be supplied by the application environment in order for
IM to know which information to preserve, disseminate or prioritize. In
our framework, information quality concerns the paradigmatic dimension:
the symbols of a representation and their relations. As this dimension
tends to be quite structured in symbolic representations, one can go
beyond the pragmatic level of IM and utilize the underlying semantic
level to understand better how information quality is determined.

The first advantage of utilizing the semantic level lies in the
definition of acceptable data as being well-formed and meaningful. This
determines the fundamental quality of data: their acceptability within a
representation. A coffee stain cannot be part of a building
representation but neither can a line segment be part of a model in BIM:
it has to be an explicit symbol of something. That symbol may have the
appearance of a line segment (i.e. uses the line segment as
implementation mechanism, as is the case for a room separation in Revit)
but the meaning of the symbol is not inferred by its appearance ---
quite the opposite: the appearance is determined by the meaning. Any
data that do not fit the specifications of a symbol, a property or a
relation cannot be well-formed or meaningful in BIM. Such data are
indications of low quality that requires attention. If quality cannot be
improved, these data should be treated as noise.

Data that pass the fundamental semantic test must then be evaluated
concerning /relevance/ for the particular building or project and its
tasks. To judge relevance, one needs additional criteria, e.g.
concerning specificity. For example, it is unlikely that a model
comprising generic building elements is satisfactory for a task like the
acoustic analysis of a classroom because the property values of generic
elements tend to be too vague regarding factors that influence acoustic
performance.

The semantic level also helps to determine information value beyond
utility: prioritizing which information should be preserved and
propagated depends on semantic type. As derivative data can be produced
from primary when needed, they do not have to be prioritized --- in many
cases, they do not have to be preserved at all. Operational data and
metadata tend to change little and infrequently in BIM, so these too
have a lower priority than primary data. Finally, anti-data have a high
priority, both because they necessitate interpretation and action, and
because such action often aims at producing missing primary data.

Parsimonious IM concerning information quality in a symbolic
representation like BIM can be summarized as follows:

1. Preservation and completion of primary data
2. Establishing transparent and efficient procedures for producing
   derivative data when needed
3. Identification and interpretation of anti-data, including
   specification of consequent actions
4. Preservation of stable operational and metadata

The priority of primary data seems to conflict with IM and its
improvement of information quality through condensation, i.e. operations
that return pragmatically superior derivative data and metadata. Such
operations belong to the second point above: if the primary data serve
as input for certain procedures, then these procedures have to be
established as a dynamic view or similar output in BIM. If users need to
know the floor areas of spaces, one should not just give them the space
dimensions and let them work out the calculations themselves but supply
instead transparent calculations, organized in a legible and meaningful
way. This does not mean that the results of these calculations should be
preserved next to the space dimensions from which they derive.

Moving from the semantic to the pragmatic level, /veracity/ is a key
criterion of quality: fitness for purpose obviously requires that the
information is true. In addition to user feedback, veracity can be
established on the basis of comparison to additional, reference data,
e.g. laser scans that confirm that a model represents faithfully,
accurately and precisely the geometry of an existing building.

Before relevance or veracity, however, one should evaluate the
structural characteristics of primary information: a model that is not
complete, coherent and consistent is a poor basis for any use.
/Completeness/ in a building representation means that all parts and
aspects are present, i.e. that there are no missing symbols for building
elements or spaces in a model. BIM software uses /deficiency detection/
to identify missing symbols. Missing aspects refer to symbol properties
or relations: the definition of symbols should include all that is
necessary to describe their structure, composition, behaviour and
performance.

Completeness is about the presence of all puzzle pieces; /coherence/ is
about how well these pieces fit together to produce a seamless overall
picture. In a building representation this primarily concerns the
interfacing of elements, including possible conflicts in space or time.
/Clash detection/ in BIM aims at identifying such conflicts,
particularly in space. Relations between symbols are of obvious
significance for coherence, so these should be made explicit and
manageable.

Finally, /consistency/ is about all parts and aspects being represented
in the same or compatible ways. In a symbolic representation, this
refers to the properties and relations of symbols. If these are
described in the same units and are present in all relevant symbol
types, then consistency is also guaranteed in information use. Colour,
for example, should be a property of the outer layer of all building
elements. In all cases, the colour should derive from the materials of
this layer. This means that any paint applied to an element should be
explicit as material with properties that include colour. Moreover, any
colour data attached to this material layer should follow a standard
like the RAL or Pantone colour matching systems. Allowing users to enter
any textual description of colour does not promote consistency.

   internal door in a design. Cluster the input by origin (general,
   specific, project) and describe the relations between input items.

   the layout of an office landscape, particularly:
   1. Which workstation types are to be included, including dimensions
      and other requirements.
   2. How instances of these types are to be arranged to achieve maximum
      capacity.
3. In a BIM editor of your choice make the permissible building envelope

* Management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: part-title
  :END:

In this part, we conclude the exploration of how digitization and
information impact on AECO by focusing on the relation between
information and management: how IM contributes to performance by
improving not only clarity and transparency but also consistency,
efficiency and effectiveness. Previous parts have explained:

- How digitization has changed expectations and attitudes concerning
  information.
- The structure of digital symbolic representations and their
  differences from analogue representations.
- What data and information are, and the principles of digital
  information management.

The viewpoint of this part is primarily managerial. While it is tempting
to focus on specific AECO aspects and disciplines, and consider
information in a narrower frame, for example study the relations between
design, creativity and representation, there are several important
reasons for adopting a managerial viewpoint. First and foremost,
management is normally about the whole of a process or project. From
this holistic perspective, information is less what each actor produces
or consumes and more what enables actors and stakeholders to interact
with each other concerning common goals and constraints; it is what
returns an overview of the whole and an understanding of parts one is
only indirectly linked to. In short, the true value of information in a
process becomes apparent when considered in the wider frame of someone
with a general mandate and overall interests.

Armed with an understanding of symbolic representations, graphs and
semantic data types from the previous parts, we consider what we do with
information when and where it matters in a process. Unfortunately, as
the next chapter explains, the answer is: not much. Our cognition
appears to be built in a way that allows us to operate effectively and
efficiently in many common situations but also makes us biased and
failure-prone in other, more demanding situations. Cognitive limitations
are hard to overcome but we should at least provide the means for
recognizing them and correcting their mistakes. The book contributes
towards this objective by stressing the duality of process and
information management, and making it operational, transparent and
supportive of reflective and analytical thinking.

* Decisions and information
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/The chapter introduces the dual-process theory and explains its
relevance to decision making in AECO. It presents the foundations of the
theory and a number of illusions, biases and fallacies that derive from
our cognitive limitations./

* Dual-process theory
One of the striking scientific developments around the turn of the
century was that several compatible and often complementary views of
mental duality emerged independently, in different contexts and
disciplines, ranging from social psychology and neuropsychology to
decision theory and economics. The notion of many different systems in
the brain is not new but what distinguishes the dual-process theory from
earlier views is that it builds on a better understanding of the brain's
biologic and cognitive structure to suggest that there are two different
types of thinking, each with different functions, strengths and
weaknesses:

1. /Type 1/ processes: these are autonomous, unconscious, automatically
   executed when relevant stimuli are encountered, unguided by
   higher-level control systems, fast, low-effort, often parallel and
   with a high processing capacity. Examples of Type 1 processes are
   simple mental calculations, such as 2 + 3, the recognition of a
   common animal species like a dog, the detection of hostility in a
   person's voice and the identification of a roof in an elevation
   drawing.
2. /Type 2/ processes, which are the opposite: controlled, analytical,
   slow, high-effort, generally serial and with a limited processing
   capacity. Examples of Type 2 processes are demanding mental
   calculations, such as 3943 × 2187, filling in an insurance form for a
   motor vehicle accident and looking for inward-opening swing doors
   wider than 67 cm in a floor plan of a large building.

For their immediate responses in a variety of situations, Type 1
processes rely on encapsulated knowledge and tightly compiled learned
information, accumulated through exposure and personal experience common
to the majority of people. Some of the best examples concern
/affordances:/ the actionable properties an environment presents to us,
such as that we can walk on a pavement or go through a door. These are
things anyone can do, usually equally well. Other things are restricted
to a minority of individuals and are often an indication of expertise,
for example in a hobby like fishing or a sport like table tennis.
Nevertheless, they are all acquired and encoded in a similar manner. In
fact, expertise in dual-process theory is seen as an extension of common
capacities through practice: in the same way a child learns to recognize
animal species, an expert learns to recognize familiar elements in new
situations and deploy ready interpretations and actions. It should be
noted that expertise is not a single skill but a large collection of
small skills: an expert footballer is capable of simultaneously (or in
quick succession) doing many small things both individually and in a
team, from controlling a ball coming at different speeds and from
different directions to passing the ball to teammates according to an
agreed plan, taking into account their individual capacities and
position in the field.

Type 2 processes are distinguished into two categories. The first
consists of /reflective /processes, which evaluate Type 1 thinking and
its results on the basis of beliefs and goals. Reflection often involves
cognitive simulation and can be triggered by the outcome of Type 1
processes, such as the feeling of doubt that arises from frequent
failure, for example constant slipping on a frozen pavement. It is also
linked to interpersonal communication and the need to explain or justify
proposed joint actions and goals, such as the tactics of a football
team. Once activated, reflective processes can interrupt or override
Type 1 processing, suppress its responses and reallocate expensive
mental resources from failing Type 1 processes to searches for
alternative solutions through Type 2 thinking.

These solutions are the subject of the second category in Type 2
thinking, /algorithmic/ processes: strategies, rule systems, general and
specific knowledge, usually learned formally and therefore bounded by
culture. For example, unlike a simple DIY job, a loft conversion
requires more meticulous organization, which can be based on empirically
acquired knowledge, a textbook on home improvement or Internet
tutorials. If the project is undertaken by AECO professionals, it
inevitably also draws from their training in design, construction, time
planning and site management. One of the basic functions of algorithmic
processes is /cognitive decoupling: /the distinction between
representations of the world used in Type 1 processes and
representations required for the analysis of imaginary or abstract
situations. Cognitive decoupling concerns both substituting the naïve
representations implicit in daily life, such as that of a flat earth,
and allowing for imaginary situations, such as a cubic earth, which form
settings for hypothetical reasoning.

It should be pointed out that Type 2 processes do not necessarily return
better results than Type 1 ones. Being highly demanding, mentally
expensive, subject to personal intelligence and knowledge, and founded
on Type 1 biases or professional thinking habits, they may also lead to
failure. Being usually acquired through formal learning, they may also
be limited or failure-prone because of theoretical and methodical
issues. For example, before the Copernican revolution, learned
astronomers made fundamental mistakes because they based their work on
erroneous earth-centric models, not because they made errors in their
calculations. What Type 2 processes certainly do is avoid the biases of
Type 1 thinking and therefore have smaller error margins, moreover
neither too high nor too low with respect to the truth. Kepler's laws of
the heliocentric model and Newtonian mechanics form a sound basis for
calculating planetary motion with sufficient precision and accuracy,
regardless of the means used for the calculation.

Dual-process theory has a number of advantages that explain its
acceptance and popularity in many application areas. One advantage is
that it makes evident why we are are so good at some tasks and so poor
at others. For example, we are good grammarians: children at the age of
four are already capable of forming grammatically correct sentences. By
contrast, we are poor statisticians: we are clever enough to have
invented statistics but nevertheless fail to apply statistical thinking
in everyday situations that clearly demand it, such as games of chance.
The reason for this is that Type 1 processes represent categories by
prototypes or typical examples. As a result, they rely on averages and
stereotypes, avoiding even relatively easy calculations for drawing
conclusions about individual cases from what is known about relevant
categories. Interestingly, most people have little difficulty making
these Type 2 calculations when asked to do so.

Such variability in cognitive performance should not be mistaken for
inconsistency. It is instead an indication of conflicts that are
inherent in our cognitive mechanisms. Dual-process theory has the
advantage that it includes these conflicts in its core, as opposed to
treating them as a loose collection of anomalies to be resolved
afterwards, as exceptions to the rules. The most fundamental conflict is
that Type 1 processes which undeniably serve us well in most situations
are also the cause of frequent and persistent failures, some of which
are discussed below. A related conflict is the constant struggle between
Type 1 and Type 2 thinking for dominance and mental resources. At
practically every moment of the day, we need to choose between what we
do automatically and what requires analytical treatment. Sometimes what
attracts our attention is an established priority, such as as an exam
question. At other times, it is a sudden occurrence or a new priority,
for example a sudden opening of a door or a cramp in the writing arm. At
yet other times, it is anti-data, such as a pen that fails to write. We
are constantly asked to prioritize in a continually changing landscape
of often apparently unrelated tasks that nevertheless affect our
performance both overall and with respect to specific goals.
Unfortunately, we often fail because of Type 1 biases and underlying
cognitive limitations.

* Cognitive illusions, biases, Fallacies and failures
** Inattentional and change blindness
A typical failure caused by our cognitive limitations is /inattentional
blindness: /we systematically fail to notice unexpected things and
events, especially when we are concentrating on another, relatively hard
task. This is why we may fail to see a cyclist appear next to the car we
are driving in heavy traffic (unless of course cyclists are an expected
part of this traffic, as in most Dutch cities). Inattentional blindness
is hazardous in traffic but the same neglect for unexpected things
around us is actually helpful in many other situations because it allows
us to reserve our limited cognitive capacities for important tasks at
hand. When taking an exam, for example, we do not want to be distracted
by extraneous stimuli, such as noise coming from outside, unnecessary
movement in the room or incoming messages on social media.

Closely related is/ change blindness:/ the failure to see obvious
changes in something unfolding in front of our eyes, primarily because
we are concentrating on something else, usually a narrative (a subject
discussed in more detail later in this chapter). Typical examples are
continuity errors in films, which most viewers miss until someone points
them out, making them immediately and permanently glaringly obvious to
all. Just like inattentional blindness, change blindness is due to our
memory limitations: perception is followed by recognition of meaning,
which is what we encode in memory rather than every detail of the
percept. What we retain in memory is an image or narrative that is above
all coherent and consistent with its meaning. This also means that we
may embellish the memory with fictitious details that fit the meaning
and the emotions it elicits. Vivid details are often an indication of
such reproduction /after /the memory was formed.

** Planning and sunk-costs fallacies
A popular subject in news stories are projects poorly conceived by
clients and developers, inadequately understood by politicians and
authorities that endorse them, and unquestioningly attempted by
designers and engineers, with dramatic failures as a result. Such
projects are often linked to the /planning fallacy: /we tend to make
designs, plans and forecasts unrealistically close to best-case
scenarios, neglecting to compare them to the outcomes of similar
projects, therefore repeating mistakes that have led to previous
failures. Common reasons behind the planning fallacy are the desire to
have a design approved, pressure to have a project completed and a
general tendency to act fast so as not to delay. These push decision
makers to quick, overoptimistic, typically Type 1 decisions that remain
unchecked.

Interestingly, these attitudes persist when the failure becomes
apparent, usually by the height of sunk costs. Rather than accept defeat
and cut their losses, many stakeholders insist on throwing good money
after bad, desperately continuing the project, in the vain hope to
change its fortunes around. The escalation of commitment caused by the
/sunk-costs fallacy/ is often celebrated for merely reaching some goals,
ignoring the devastation it has brought along. It seems that the height
of the sunk costs actually increases commitment, as well as the
misguided appreciation of partial goals (often just the completion of
the project), which confuses stubbornness and incompetence with heroism.

In principle, optimism in the face of danger or failure is a positive
characteristic. It encourages us to persist against obstacles and, in
many cases, to overcome them. A defeatist attitude under difficult
conditions is obviously unhelpful for survival but the same also holds
for insistence that is uninformed and uncontrolled by rational analysis.
For example, any decision to repair a damaged car should depend on the
technical and economic feasibility of the repairs, in relation to the
value and utility of the car. Endless expensive repairs of a car that
can be easily replaced by another rarely make sense.

** Inside and outside view
Such fallacies are reinforced by the tendency of stakeholders to stick
to /inside views:/ views shared by the project participants, relying too
much on information produced in the project by the participants
themselves. By repeatedly using and sharing this information, such as an
early budget or time plan, they end up believing it unquestioningly,
even when new developments should cast doubt on earlier decisions and
lead to major adjustments in the project (relation to change blindness).
Consequently, participants subscribing to an inside view tend to
underestimate problems and dangers that are evident from an /outside
view,/ i.e. one that covers the whole class to which the project belongs
and the statistics of this class. Failing to adopt outside views reduces
the validity of any basic decision in a project. It also causes
unwarranted, pervasive optimism: the mistaken belief that this project
is surely not subject to the causes of failure in other, very similar
projects.

** Illusions of knowledge, confidence and skill
Planning fallacies and inside views are linked to the /illusion of
knowledge:/ we think that we know more than we actually do because we
understand /what /happens and mistake it for an understanding of /why/
it happens. The consequence is that we rarely doubt our beliefs and
assumptions, and, when confronted with a task, we plunge into direct
action before we fully understand the situation. The more complex the
task, the more profound the illusion and the more dangerous its effects.

A complementary illusion is that of /confidence:/ we tend to delegate
tasks to actors on the basis of what they believe they can do. Even
without relevant qualifications or a convincing track record, a person
can be confident about their competence to do something and claim it.
Even worse, others are inclined to accept the claim: we treat the
confidence of a person in their abilities as a true measure of their
skill or expertise and therefore overestimate their capacities. However,
as talent shows make abundantly and embarrassingly obvious, incompetent
people are often overconfident about their abilities. They audition for
something that they clearly cannot do, not as a joke but because they
genuinely believe in themselves. Moreover, the /illusion of skill/ from
which they suffer means that they are less inclined to improve their
skills. By contrast, highly skilled persons, such as top athletes and
celebrated musicians, always look for ways to improve themselves, e.g.
through constant, demanding and often innovative training. Similarly,
true experts are aware of their limitations and scope (unlike users of
questionable or arbitrary expert-like heuristics), and constantly try to
augment or refine their interpretations and solutions in every new
situation they encounter.

The illusions of knowledge, skill and confidence are not confined to
extreme cases, like the ones in talent shows. Most people suffer from
it, typically undertaking jobs they botch and abandon, e.g. in DIY. More
importantly, they tend to attribute good performance to superior skills
or expertise rather than luck and bad performance to accidental or
unforeseen conditions that are beyond their control or to the
incompetence or obstruction of others. Even seasoned professionals may
be confident that they can achieve the necessary goals in a project,
despite having failed to deliver in previous projects. However,
experience is not the same as expertise or ability. The true hallmark of
knowledge and skill is a persistently high performance, as attested by
our expectations from e.g. professional musicians and surgeons.

** Substitution
One of the clever strategies of Type 1 thinking is that difficult
problems are routinely substituted by simpler ones. Rather than taking
the trouble of calculating a sum like 3943 × 2187 precisely, we
approximate by calculating 4 × 2 and then adding zeros for the
thousands. This is acceptable in many situations but can be misleading
in others. For example, when people are asked how happy they are, they
invariably base their answer on their current mood and give an answer
that reflects only very recent events and conditions. Regrettably, the
fluency by which Type 1 thinking finds solutions to the simple problems
makes us think that we have found adequate solutions to the complex ones
they have substituted. Consequently, we seldom attempt to solve or even
understand the complex problems. Instead, we resort to approximations
and received wisdom, and so frequently fail to utilize the tools,
knowledge and information at our disposal. Simplifying a mental
calculation may be a clever strategy but doing so in a spreadsheet or a
calculator is pointless, especially if precision is required.

** Framing
Fallacies and illusions often relate to /narrow framing:/ focusing on
the individual project rather than the enterprises involved in it or
focusing on a single problem rather than the whole project. What appears
to be the right decision in a narrow frame is often patently wrong when
considered more broadly, in relation to other issues and options or for
a longer term. However embarrassing, the termination of a failing
project may be right for the enterprise and its fortunes, as it allows
allocation of resources elsewhere instead of increasing sunk costs.
Crucially, a situation can be framed positively or negatively. Our
reactions to e.g. the Internet are influenced by how it is presented:
either as a source of hidden dangers or a universe of new opportunities.
Similarly, a budget overrun by 46,3 million euros for a major, demanding
building may raise few eyebrows among people familiar with much worse
cases in infrastructure and defence projects but the same overrun
expressed as 26% of the original budget sounds more
serious.[[#chapter-008-decisions-and-information.xhtml#footnote-259-1][^{[1]}]]

One of the most significant recent developments in decision theory goes
beyond the realization that framing and the context it creates influence
decision taking: it actively deploys a /choice architecture /that
structures this context and /nudges/ decisions towards better choices
without forcing any outcomes. This involves using suitable defaults
(e.g. opting out of organ donation instead of opting in) and making the
various options more comprehensible (by providing clear information on
what they entail in both short and long term) to prevent people from
taking simplistic solutions when the number of choices and complexity of
problems increase. Nudging accepts the possibility that people make
errors and develops means to suppress them. In addition to the above
feedforward mechanisms, a choice architecture should also provide
feedback that informs people on the consequences of their decisions,
warns them if things go wrong and allows them to learn about the tasks
they are facing and their own behaviour and performance.

** Narratives, coherence and causes
We have all experienced it in one form or another: we have attended a
presentation that convinced us but afterwards it was unclear why; we
have enjoyed watching a film only to realize later that the plot was
full of holes. The success of a narrative is often due to the /halo
effect:/ a presentation delivered by someone we like, respect or admire
is received positively by Type 1 thinking, often impeding Type 2
processes from analysing its content. But even without this effect, our
love of narratives and the coherence they bring to our perceptions and
experiences are decisive. Type 1 thinking looks for coherence in a story
and confuses it with quality of evidence: if the narrative is coherent,
it is plausible and therefore acceptable. Its probability matters
little; it suffices that it is a simple, concrete story about a few
striking events, with enough detail to make it realistic.

This is the kind of stories that convinces and appeals to us in real
life, in literature or in films. These stories usually tell us that
practically everything is due to talent, stupidity or intention. They
can therefore be didactic or inspirational, allowing us to marvel at the
leadership of a great military hero or a titan of industry. The role of
luck and circumstance is often ignored, in a way that makes us believe
not only that we understand the past and the present but also predict
and control the future. On the positive side, this allows the
development of beliefs and confidence in them, so that we are not easily
daunted by adversity or yet unsolved problems. The “never mind, we'll
find a solution; let's crack on now” mentality can be beneficial for
survival but not necessarily helpful with problems that require careful
analysis and planning, such as big construction projects.

Unfortunately, narratives may contain invented causes that help facts
connect and make sense together. This also implies selectivity as to
which facts are included. As information is costly to obtain, store and
process in our brains, we apply the same simplification as in our
memories: we reduce narratives into something simple that makes sense
and reveals agents, intentions and causes with clear characteristics and
relations. Interestingly, we then embellish narratives (similarly to
memories) with details that make them more believable, consistent and
coherent --- details that may have been invented or imagined, at the
cost of others that reveal the complexity or randomness of reality. This
retrospective distortion of facts enhances the illusion of fully
understanding reality and being able to predict it, and sustains a
dangerous eagerness to accept overgeneralizations like “generation X”,
zodiac signs or perfect curves that profess to be analytical, despite
their lack of foundation in real data.

Part of the appeal of narratives lies in their linear structure, which
reinforces three biases that make us jump to conclusions: our minds are
built to assume causality on the basis of precedence in time, to infer
causes from coincidence and to detect meaning in patterns. These Type 1
cornerstones allow us to connect events like the flicking of a switch to
a light turning on, identify malfunctions in a machine by the sounds it
makes and recognize familiar persons in a crowd by the way they move. On
the negative side, they lead to /illusions of cause/ when we infer
relations and patterns in random data. The illusion may affect even
experts who, when confronted with randomness or unknown patterns, do not
pause to consider alternatives but remain in Type 1 mode and seek
confirmation of what they know or expect. Spurious correlations are
quite easy to find given enough data but unfortunately not all of them
are as obviously ridiculous as the link of US spending on science, space
and technology to the number of suicides by hanging, strangulation or
suffocation; margarine consumption to the divorce rate in Maine; the age
of Miss America to murders by steam, hot vapours or hot objects; the
consumption of mozzarella cheese to civil engineering doctorates; or
superstitions like an athlete always wearing the same “lucky”
socks.[[#chapter-008-decisions-and-information.xhtml#footnote-259-2][^{[2]}]]

Narratives are also inherently unfair, as we realize from the need to
change the narratives of the colonial past: the old depictions and
descriptions of persons and events were at best partial and selective,
providing coherence and simplicity by downplaying the complexity of a
world that often seems inexplicable because it contains things we
consider improbable or fixed. Change blindness makes us fail to notice
things that change if they fall outside the narrative and so eliminate
them from the story, which is then presented in a way that reinforces
the remaining points. In this way, other facts and perspectives remain
hidden, only to resurface too late, when the partiality and unfairness
of the narrative has become painfully obvious.

* Dual processes and information
A widely accepted explanation for our frequent, systematic cognitive
failures is that the otherwise highly efficient Type 1 processes stem
from our evolution and adaptation to a world quite different to today's
highly technological, fast and busy environment. Back then, our
cognitive systems developed ways to allocate their limited resources for
the requirements of fundamental tasks at walking or running speed, not
for demanding problems in mathematics or the much higher speed of
motorized traffic. The world has since changed, as have our activities
and priorities it it, but Type 1 processes remain the same, making us
prone to biases and errors. What makes us able to use simple
construction tools to build a garden wall is not what is required in
planning and executing the realization of a skyscraper.

Unfortunately, our capability at many everyday tasks makes us
overconfident about our cognitive abilities in general. We confuse the
fluency of Type 1 processes with deep understanding and treat it as a
general performance guarantee. This causes the cognitive illusions that
make us underperform with worrying regularity. Even worse, we seem
unable to appreciate the significance of these illusions and the
frequency or magnitude of our failures. Law courts, for example, insist
on putting too much weight on eyewitness accounts, despite known
limitations of our memory and especially the tendency to reconstruct
memories and complement them with fictitious details that enhance their
meaning.

Most scientists agree that our cognitive limitations cannot be avoided.
All we can do is be aware of them and remain alert to situations and
conditions that require activation of Type 2 reflective processes: learn
to recognize and neutralize biases, so as to avoid the pitfalls of
intuitive, automatic decisions and actions. To do so, we require
information that helps us both fully understand the situation and
identify better solutions through Type 2 algorithmic processing. Making
explicit the information surrounding every task in a process is
therefore a prerequisite to any improvement in our decision making.
Finding this information and processing it towards better solutions
often involves the use of technologies that aid memory, such as writing,
or processing, such as calculators. It follows that digital information
technologies are a key part of the further, hybrid evolution of human
thinking. Matching their structure and potential to our cognitive
capacities is the starting point for understanding how IM can support
decision making.

* AECO and dual-process theory
Among the examples of failure mentioned in dual-process literature, AECO
has a prominent place: its history is full of examples of the planning
fallacy. Defence, industrial, ICT and infrastructure projects may result
in higher overruns but the AECO examples are far more frequent and
widespread. The reasons behind the planning fallacy appear to be endemic
in AECO and regularly lead to hasty designs or project plans, build on
largely unfounded Type 1 decisions. As one would expect, the disregard
for realism and reliability does not change when projects start to fail
or are affected by sunk costs. AECO stakeholders stubbornly keep
investing in failures, focusing on project goals and anchoring on plans
that are clearly faulty. Despite the availability of data, knowledge and
advanced tools, many decisions are taken on the basis of norms and rules
of thumb, which encourage superficial treatment of building performance
and process structure. The result is that costs increase
disproportionately, while even minor cuts or concessions dramatically
reduce quality and scope. In the end, it seems that all that matters is
that the buildings are realized, however expensive or poor. Even when we
avoid outright failure, we generally produce buildings with the same
severe limitations, through the same processes that have returned so
many earlier mediocrities or failures.

The planning fallacy in AECO is reinforced by strong inside views. The
dictum “every building is unique” is misleading because it ignores
similarities not only between the composition and performance of
buildings at various levels (from that of individual parts like doors
and corridors to common configurations like open-plan offices) but also
between the processes of development, realization and use in different
projects. It leads to an arrogant, persistent repetition of the same
mistakes, coupled to lack of interest in thorough analyses that can
reveal what goes wrong. It seems than the main priority of AECO is to
keep on producing, even though the high turnover in construction is
linked to a rather low mark-up for many stakeholders.

Under these conditions, substitution is rife in AECO. Practically
everything is kept as simple as possible, regardless of what is actually
needed. This especially affects forecasts, such as cost estimates, and
analyses, which are reduced to mere box ticking against basic norms like
building codes. Compliance clearly weighs more heavily than real
performance and this adds to the persistence of outdated approaches and
technologies. While other production sectors increasingly invest in
advanced computerization, AECO insists on doing too much manually,
simultaneously heavily relying on cheap labour.

Such issues are exacerbated by the frequently loose structure of AECO
processes, which include large numbers of black boxes with uncertain
connections between them. These black boxes generally relate to the
illusion of confidence, which underlies the delegation of aspects and
responsibilities to specific actors. It is often enough that these
actors represent a discipline relevant to an aspect; if they also
emanate confidence in their knowledge and decisions, we tend to take it
for granted that they know what they are doing and so impose few if any
checks on their contributions --- checks on which any sensible manager
should insist anyway, given the high failure rate in AECO projects and
the blame games that follow failure.

As for narratives and their capacity to obscure true causes, the halo
effect has a strong presence in AECO, as attested by the attention given
to famous architects and the belief that their designs are good by
default. Any failure by a grand name is either a heroic one, attempted
against all odds, or the result of unjust lack of acceptance or support
by others. The culture of learning from prominent peers means that
lesser AECO professionals are also fully aware of the power of a
coherent narrative and therefore often choose to focus on simple, strong
ideas rather than detailed, fully worked-out designs and plans. This is
facilitated by ritual processes, formulated as prescriptive, box-ticking
sequences of actions, products and stages: a process can usually proceed
only if the previous steps have been completed, for example, if there
are drawings of the design at the agreed scale, budgets and time
schedules. The presence of these carriers is more important than the
quality of their content, which remains unchecked until a problem
emerges later on. So long as the coherence of the core narrative holds,
we see what we want to see, oblivious to our inattentional or change
blindness. This also leads to illusions of cause: we often attribute
problems and failures to the immediately previous stage of a project,
instead of searching for true causes throughout the project.

The fallacies and illusions in AECO are closely related to narrow and
biased framing that isolates problems and solutions. For example, policy
makers propose intensified, denser and higher housing construction in
the Dutch Randstad in order to meet demand, without linking this to
other issues, such as environmental concerns (e.g. the negative effects
of urban heat islands) or transportation problems. These issues are
subjects of other ongoing debates and current policies, which are kept
separate, even though they are obviously related to urbanization and
will be directly affected by housing development. By keeping them out of
the housing demand frame, their resolution is deferred to a later stage,
when the effects of this urbanization wave may have become painfully
apparent and possibly irreversible. The danger is that they will be
addressed only then, again in a piecemeal, narrow-frame fashion.

In short, despite the nature of its problems and solutions, AECO
thinking appears dominated by Type 1 processes. Quick decisions based on
norm, habit, principle or goal proliferate, notwithstanding the
availability of detailed specifications (e.g. construction drawings)
that could be used for precise evaluations of validity and feasibility.
Moreover, such specifications and evaluations usually come after the
decisions are taken and are constrained by resulting narratives: what
does not fit the basic message that should conveyed in a project is
frequently underplayed.

* The social and information sides
An ingrained bias in process management is the frequent overemphasis on
the social side: the stakeholders and actors, their interests, what they
should do and when, and how to align them towards common goals and joint
products. While this side of management is obviously significant, it
also entails the danger of black boxes, formed out of generic, vague
assumptions and expectations. We roughly know the capacities and remit
of each participant in a project, so we feel disinclined to specify
their contributions to the project or the connections between
contributions in detail. Instead, we assume that everyone will do their
bit and problems will be solved automatically, perhaps even before we
realize their existence.

However, as the dual-process theory explains, this view is a highly
suspect product of Type 1 thinking. The consequences of uncontrollable
black boxes and undefined connections can be quite grave. A manager can
always adopt a laissez-faire attitude and wait for crises to emerge in a
project, in the knowledge that crises trigger action. Unfortunately, not
all problems qualify as crises. In many cases, failure is the sum of
many smaller problems that remain systematically unsolved (a
characteristic malaise in AECO). But even when the problems are big
enough for the crisis to be recognized, it may be too late for effective
and economic solutions (as the sunk-costs fallacy indicates). The
obvious solution is to structure processes clearly and consistently as a
sequence of specific tasks for particular actors (the subject of the
chapter on process diagrams), so that we can deploy constructive Type 2
reflection. However, the resulting critical review of a process is not
enough. We additionally need to understand and control the process in
terms of its main currency, information: what connects stakeholders,
actors and tasks, what is consumed and produced in each task.

By managing information in addition to social interactions, we ensure
that each task receives the right input and returns the right output,
that tasks are unambiguously linked (as the output of one becomes input
to another) and that all tasks are consistently and coherently
specified. Each participant can consequently know what is required of
them, and what they should have to do their job. This makes the
management of a process transparent and controllable, devoid of black
boxes and grey areas. In this sense, the information side validates the
social side, revealing possible gaps and inconsistencies, and removing
unnecessary vagueness from the process.

Decision making in AECO is ostensibly based on expertise and often takes
place in settings that justify the emphasis on expertise: confusing and
dynamic situations, unclear goals and poorly defined procedures, a
looming larger context and time pressure. These are typical of
conditions in the field, where true experts, such as firefighters,
pilots and nurses, must take rapid, difficult decisions under pressure
and uncertainty. One could argue that similar conditions exist in many
AECO situations, from design reviews to construction sites. However, the
similarity is generally superficial or even artificial. There are very
few situations in AECO that qualify as true emergencies. In most cases,
it is the emphasis on the social side of management and the power games
it involves that define the conditions, underplaying the information
side and its significance for decision making. In essence, emergency
conditions are created in AECO through poor preparation, inadequate
procedures and lack of analyses or development in depth. Such
inadequacies create the illusion that decisions must be taken on
principle or on the basis of expertise and in total disregard to the
huge amounts of information AECO professionals typically produce in
documenting a situation and developing a design or plan. Relegating this
information to a mere background for the personalities involved in a
project makes little sense for the functioning of decision makers, as
well as with respect to the information-intensive character of AECO.

Even when expertise is called for, it is not a matter of gut feeling
alone. Analyses of decision making by experts suggest that it is a
two-stage process: it does start with intuition (recognition of how one
needs to respond to a situation) but this is followed by deliberate
evaluation (simulation of response and its outcomes). In this blend of
intuition and analysis, the simulation can be mental but is nevertheless
based on information, including both general rules and specific
characteristics of the particular situation. A firefighter, for example,
needs to know the materials and structure of a building on fire in order
to predict how the envelope and the load-bearing structure may behave or
how smoke may develop in egress routes. The more relevant information is
available, the better for the decision making. Furthermore, experts
often rely on explicit information tools for aiding their memory and
structuring their procedures, such as data charts and checklists.

The conclusion we can draw from this is that even if we treat every
participant in an AECO project as an expert, capable of amazing Type 1
feats, there is every reason to invest in IM for a number of critical
reasons:

- Clear information structures and flows allow managers to understand
  what takes place and guide the process.
- Reliable and meaningful information around each task helps other
  participants evaluate and adjust their own actions, generally without
  the need for interventions by manager.
- Any such intervention can be made less confrontational, as well as
  more operational, if conveyed through information.

* Process diagrams
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/This chapter/ /explains how a process can be described as a graph of
tasks that affords overview and supports reliable planning and effective
guidance for each task and the whole process. By doing so, process
diagrams address many questions on the social side of management. The
chapter presupposes knowledge of graphs and in particular of directed
graphs (see Appendix I). /

* Process descriptions
As we have seen in the chapter on IM, there is a strong correspondence
between the sequence of tasks in a process and the sequence of
information actions: process management and IM overlap. Therefore, the
first step towards effective IM in any process is understanding the
process itself: what people do and how their actions, decisions,
interactions and transactions relate to the production, dissemination
and utilization of information. Starting IM by analysing the process
also has advantages for the deployment of IM measures: most people and
organizations are more process-oriented than information-oriented. As a
result, they may have difficulty identifying and organizing information
actions without a clear operational context. Using a process model as
basis makes clearer why and how one should manage information.

The various ways of describing processes fall under two main kinds:

1. /Textual/ descriptions, such as reports, often including tables and
   lists that summarize key points
2. /Diagrammatic/ descriptions: visual displays of the process
   structure, either focusing on the overall picture or providing
   step-by-step descriptions of the process flow

The two kinds are complementary: textual descriptions can be detailed
specifications, while diagrammatic ones afford overview. This
fundamental difference makes textual descriptions better suited for the
level of single tasks and diagrammatic ones the unmissable starting
point for the whole process. Doing away with diagrammatic descriptions
and relying solely on texts is inadvisable because of the resulting
difficulty in constructing mental overviews. Recognizing dependencies
between multiple tasks, redundancies, omissions and other process
characteristics is quite demanding for any reader of a text. It can lead
to unnecessary errors in interpretation, including through illusions of
cause from presumed precedence or coincidence in time, especially in
sequential processes (which abound in AECO). Diagrammatic descriptions
help us overcome such cognitive limitations by serving as mnemonic aids
for understanding and managing processes: they can be seen as checklists
of tasks and of relations between tasks that unburden actors' memories
and prevent them from missing critical steps or available options at any
step in a process.

This chapter builds on the potential of graphs to answer two fundamental
questions:

1. /How /process diagrams should be made: the syntactic and semantic
   rules they should follow to capture the composition and structure of
   tasks in a process with the right abstraction and consistency
2. /Which problems/ can be addressed in these diagrams, with emphasis on
   the unwanted products of Type 1 thinking, so that the social side of
   management becomes both more specific and free from cognitive
   illusions and fallacies

* Flowcharts
Basic flowcharts suffice for describing practically any AECO process as
a sequence of tasks towards a specific outcome. These diagrams are
directed graphs (/digaphs/), in which objects are represented by /nodes/
of various kinds, while relations are described by /arcs/ (Figure 1).
The direction of the arcs indicates the direction of flow in the
process. Bidirectional arcs should be avoided because they usually fuse
different relations, obscuring differences in time and purpose between
denoted actions, e.g. between an evaluation and the feedback that
follows. Separate representation of each such action is essential for
understanding and managing process flow.

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. Nodes and arcs in a flowchart/
[[file:media/assets/flow-chart-nodes-arcs-679x1024-1.png]]

 

To make an usable flowchart of a process, one should adhere to a few
basic rules:

- /Uniqueness:/ each thing should be represented by a single node in the
  diagram. The uniqueness rule makes explicit the actors, stakeholders
  and tasks in a process, the scope of each, process flow and, through
  these, the overall complexity of a process. It also permits the use of
  graph-theoretic measures, such as the degree of a node, in analysing
  the process.
- /Decision degrees:/ the in- and out-degrees of each decision node
  should be at least 2. This means that there are at least two things to
  be compared in order to take the decision, for example a design and a
  brief, and at least two decisions that could be taken, for example
  design improvement or approval.
- /Specificity and comprehensiveness:/ a process flowchart is not an
  abstract depiction of vague intentions, like many conceptual diagrams.
  Each node and arc should be meaningful as an unambiguous actor, task
  or relation. No directly relevant task or relation should be left
  implicit or otherwise absent from the diagram. For example, it is not
  helpful to assume that a design is somehow evaluated anyway and
  neglect including the evaluation tasks in the diagram or omit the
  criteria of the evaluation.

Figure 2 is a simple example of a process in building design: the
estimation of construction cost in early design, on the basis of gross
floor area. The process involves three actors: a client, an architect
and a cost specialist. These are responsible for the budget, the design,
the cost estimation and the evaluation of the estimate, which leads to
either feedback to the design (usually to lower the cost) or acceptance
of the design as it is. The process described by the diagram is as
follows:

1. The client decides on a budget for the building
2. The architect makes a design for that budget
3. The cost specialist estimates the costs of that design
4. The design is evaluated by comparing its costs to the budget
5. If the costs are within the budget, the design is approved; if not,
   the design must be improved and evaluated again (repeat from step 2)

 

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Cost estimation process diagram/
[[file:media/assets/cost-process-2-795x1024.png]]

 

The comparison between this list of steps and the process diagram is
telling: there is nothing in the list that cannot be inferred from the
diagram. Reading the diagram is faster than reading the list and the
process structure is easier to recognize in the diagram than in the
list, especially concerning relations between tasks. If the list was
replaced by a less structured text, the differences would become even
greater.

The example is purposely kept simple in order to illustrate the basic
principles of process diagramming. A client obviously issues more
instructions and requirements, e.g. a design brief, while the design
must also take into account other goals and constraints, such as the
applicable building codes and planning regulations, location features
etc. Even in this simple form, however, the diagram accurately describes
the fundamental structure of cost estimation, including the double role
of the budget as a constraint in designing and as a criterion for design
evaluation, as well as the generate-and-test approach to design (with
analysis between generation and testing).

Due to the uniqueness rule, there is a single node for the design.
Evaluation is followed not by a new design node but by feedback to the
design. This makes clear that the decision is to improve the design
rather than produce a completely new design, possibly by a new architect
or with a new budget. This expresses the iterative character of design:
the cost evaluation can be repeated a number of times, each resulting in
design improvements, until finally the evaluation returns approval of
the design. The example contains feedback only to the design but it
could also feed back to the budget if the design evaluation suggested
that higher investment, e.g. an energetic solution that raised
construction costs but lowered operation costs, would return significant
life-cycle benefits.

A process diagram without feedback loops is by definition suspect.
Figure 3 is a negative example (a poor diagram), which also violates the
uniqueness and decision degrees rules: it is as if many architects are
involved, each producing a different design that is subjected to a
different evaluation with unclear criteria and outcomes. Above all,
however, it presents an iterative process as sequential, with an
arbitrary, unsatisfactory conclusion that comes only because the diagram
ran out of space. In comparison, Figure 2 leaves no fundamental matters
unspecified, including by means of feedback to an earlier task following
a transparent decision.

 

#+caption: /Figure 3. Inappropriate process diagram: among other
mistakes, it describes an iterative design process as sequential/
[[file:media/assets/serial-design-664x1024.png]]

 

In short, the diagram in Figure 2 affords overview of the process in the
same way that a metro map allows travellers to see every station and
line in a city, the location of each station, its connections to others
via different lines and the patterns that emerge in each line and any
part of the metro network. The process diagram allows us to zoom in on
any task, understand its immediate context, track how we come to that
task and where we go from there, as well as identify general
characteristics of the process, for example if it is sequential or
iterative.

* Testing process diagrams
A basic way of testing the structure and content of basic diagrams is
from the perspective of each actor and stakeholder. Starting from the
beginning of the process, we need to consider at each node if this actor
or stakeholder is related to this task (i.e link /what/ to /who/ and
consequently also /how/). If yes, then we need to establish if the
connection is:

- /Direct/: it is a task that should be undertaken by this particular
  actor, e.g. the design by the architect
- /Indirect/: it connects to another task by this stakeholder, e.g. the
  architect needs the budget to guide the design costs

Once this is completed and the diagram accordingly corrected, the
involvement of each actor and stakeholder can be tracked in the process
(i.e. extend to /when/). To do this, we need to examine the subgraph
that contains all directed walks that start from the node of the actor
or stakeholder. Figure 4 is the subgraph of the cost specialist, in
which there are two directed walks to design approval: one directly
after evaluation and one following feedback to design. In this subgraph,
we can identify the extent of the cost specialist's involvement, examine
if the sequence of the process steps is logical and, on the basis of
anti-data, identify relations to other actors, stakeholders and tasks,
e.g. who is making the design improvements following feedback and what
are the criteria for the evaluation (i.e. that the evaluation node
should connect to a budget). The results returned from this examination
are obviously significant for the functioning of the particular actor or
stakeholder but also useful for the manager: in many situations, missing
nodes and especially arcs become apparent only in such subgraphs.

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. The subgraph of the cost specialist/
[[file:media/assets/cost-process-2_cost-specialist.png]]

 

Following the examination of each perspective separately, we should
investigate how they come together in a simulation the process flow.
This is best done by a group, in which each member assumes the role of
an actor or stakeholder. In board-game fashion, the simulation goes
through the process step by step, stopping at every task to consider not
only if the task is fully and clearly specified but also where each
actor and stakeholder is at that step of the process. The former makes
clear the interactions between actors and stakeholders, including
through their products. The latter helps anticipate the nature and
timing of upcoming interactions, e.g. that the budget should be
available before the architect starts designing. Many conflicts in a
process are due to bad timing and the consequent need to make haste in
order to catch up with the process flow.

* Overcoming cognitive limitations
The overview afforded by process diagrams is not merely practical for
explaining the process, so that all actors know what to do and when, and
managers can organize actions towards project goals. It is also
instrumental for overcoming cognitive limitations that lead to mistakes
and failures. Acknowledging that project participants may suffer from
cognitive biases and illusions, and trying to help avoid them is a key
managerial task. For example, explicit connections between tasks help
avoid illusions of cause. If the connections are accurate and no tasks
are missing, one cannot easily infer fictitious causes from accidental
precedence or coincidence in time.

To achieve such protection, it is important to avoid thinking in
conventional, vague structures, such as preliminary, concept, technical
and detail design stages. In a process diagram, such stages should never
become nodes. Instead, all stages should be parsed into specific tasks
and patterns, like the evaluation pattern in Figure 2, which matches any
stage and therefore supports condensation. Distrust of conventional
structures is important for the successful deployment of Type 2
reflective processes. These are often acquired by education and
training, and therefore reflect cultural and professional habits. As a
result, they may actually discourage analytical thinking by imposing
rules of thumb and other summary or pseudo-analytical decision
structures, which are embedded in conventions we tend to follow
unthinkingly.

It is also important that managers are aware of their own cognitive
limitations and how these can affect a process. Process diagrams can
protect actors individually and as a group from avoidable mistakes but
the same applies to mistakes managers make in the setup and control of
the process. The most common of these relate to illusions of confidence
and skill that cause managers to allocate tasks or even delegate
custodianship of whole parts of a process without sufficient control
(black boxes). Making the relations between actors, stakeholders and
tasks explicit is a solid foundation for avoiding such illusions.

** Reflective thinking, cognitive simulation and learning potential
A general advantage of a process diagram like Figure 2 is that it
stimulates Type 2 reflective thinking. In contrast to an inspirational
conceptual diagram, a flowchart like this supports analytical
anticipation of actions and outcomes in an explicit manner that reveals
unsolved problems and casts doubt on automatic decisions based on habit
or convention. Unlike the mind-numbing Figure 3, it invites us to
actively follow progress in a process, discovering possible problems on
the way. By tracking the dipaths that lead to a node of interest or
depart from it, we can examine if anything is missing or uncertain, if
the connections between tasks seem doubtful or vague, or if the diagram
contains practices that have led to failures in other projects. For
example, a client may rightly worry that feedback to the design could
lead to endless iterations with minimal improvements every time and
therefore to considerable delays.

The diagram also supports improving the process through Type 2
algorithmic thinking. By tracking and evaluating progress, developing
variations and measuring the graph we engage in cognitive simulation
that allows all actors and stakeholders to test their assumptions and
verify their expectations in an interactive manner. At a basic yet
critical level, a process diagram can be used to verify the process
frame, that is, if all options and consequences of each decision, all
goals and constraints are present. For example, the budget cannot be
absent from Figure 2: how else can we evaluate the costs of the design?

With the right frame, we can then consider improvements either by
tweaking the process design or by projecting what-if and other
scenarios, so as to connect better to project constraints or the
perspectives of various participants. This helps anticipate problems and
so prevent planning and sunk-costs fallacies. In the example of Figure
2, how long can we keep on with the iterations in a generally acceptable
but not perfect situation? By evaluating the improvement achieved with
each iteration, we can see if the design is reaching a plateau and take
the decision to abandon or approve it, even if the costs are still
higher than the budget. Alternatively, we can impose a ceiling on costs
(as in Figure 5), so that the difference between costs and budget is not
so big that the iterations become pointless. This nudges the design
towards staying close to the budget, for example by constraining the
selection of construction types and finishes.

Allowing for problems that could not have been anticipated is more
difficult and requires awareness of Type 1 thinking limitations in both
process management and the contributions of each actor. The interaction
between the two is critical: the process design should stimulate
reflective thinking in all respects, allowing actors to reflect not only
on their own tasks but also on the whole process. Precision in the
description of tasks is an important prerequisite because it stimulates
meaningful questions about how and why. For instance, it can stimulate
actors to question whether the cost estimate and approval in Figure 2
should be binding for the whole design project: this estimate is rather
rough and relies heavily on the new design being quite similar to other
buildings from which reference costs are derived. Therefore, making more
detailed and precise estimations, including by refining the reference
class, should be considered as soon as the design information allows it
and before the difference between later, more detailed estimates and
this one become an issue of contention in the project.

Working with analytical process diagrams is also important for skill
development. In many activities, such as sports or music, improvement
depends on instant feedback that triggers calibration: a wrong pass or a
false note immediately call for evaluation and adjustment. In areas like
AECO, there is a long latency period between taking a decision and
realizing its effects --- so long and so obscured by intervening events
(therefore also subject to illusions of cause) that the relation between
cause and effect may completely elude us. In the absence of instant
feedback, it is perhaps not surprising that we opt for optimism and
confidence. Cognitive simulation with process diagrams compresses time,
making it easier to discern probable consequences of specific decisions
before they occur, reconsider these decisions and their backgrounds, and
so understand and learn.

** Framing
The functions of a process diagram (providing overview, stimulating
reflective thinking, supporting cognitive simulation and generally
helping avoid Type 1 mistakes) require an appropriately broad frame: one
that includes all relevant aspects and constraints, as well as all
probable options and outcomes. In such a frame, we can easily detect
dependencies between tasks and consequently take properly informed
decisions at any task and prevent the spread of local mistakes to the
rest of the process. However, a broad, inclusive frame goes against the
conventional wisdom that reducing the complexity of a phenomenon makes
it easier to understand and handle. This is something frequently done in
conceptual diagrams, to the detriment of clarity. Process diagrams do
not necessarily reduce the complexity of a process. Instead, they make
it explicit and manageable, preventing the isolation of subproblems in
narrow frames.

With respect to framing, a process diagram should go beyond stated
objectives and include all things that connect directly to each task in
the process, whether they occur in the process or not. In a design
process, for example, the diagram should include the applicable planning
regulations and possibly the local authorities behind them. The reason
is that the regulations constrain many decisions on the form of the
design and the local authorities may have to grant an exemption from
these regulations. If an exemption is probable, the process diagram
should also include feedback to the regulations. Things with an indirect
relation to the process, for example the legal framework of planning
regulations and the central authorities that determine it are highly
unlikely to play a role in a design process (e.g. receive direct
feedback from any process task). These should not be included in the
process diagram.

In the digraph of the process diagram, extraneous nodes of questionable
relevance can be detected by their degree. Long subgraphs starting from
a source node and having an in- and out-degree sequence of ones should
be considered for exclusion because they probably describe tasks that
are irrelevant to the process (Figure 5). As a rule, such peripheral
subgraphs, starting from a source node, should have a length of 2 or
less: one actor or stakeholder node and one task node, the latter
connecting to a task that certainly belongs to the process, as with the
client/brief subgraph in Figure 2. If the source is a constraint, e.g.
planning regulations, and the planning authorities are not involved,
then the length can be 1.

tasks /

A related use of graph measures is to make certain that the core of the
process, i.e. all essential tasks are in the center of the graph, with
actors, stakeholders, preparatory and external tasks in the periphery.
If the center contains non-essential or peripheral nodes, the digraph
probably contains extraneous nodes.

There are two complementary ways you can measure the center and
periphery of a process diagram. The first is to do it in the underlying
undirected graph, i.e. the graph that is obtained if every arc is
replaced by an edge (Table 1). As any process diagram is a weakly
connected digraph, this returns an impression of the overall structure
of the process. In this example, the center comprises the design and
evaluation nodes. The client and cost specialist nodes form the
periphery. The closeness measures agree with the interpretation of the
center but also suggest that the architect and design approval nodes are
not as central as the budget and cost estimation nodes.

undirected graph of Figure 2/

 

The second way is to measure distances in the digraph itself (Table 2).
Note that as distances are measured in dipaths, there are many nodes
that do not connect to each other and that the table is not symmetric
with respect to the diagonal: the distance from node /X /to node /Y/ is
not the same as the distance from node /Y/ to node /X/. The measures in
our example suggest that the core of the process comprises the budget,
cost estimation and evaluation nodes, with only the architect in the
periphery. In terms of closeness, the evaluation node is the most
central, followed by the cost estimation, while the client and the cost
specialist are closer to the architect. In other words, the digraph
measures give a slightly different view, more specific to the cost
estimation process. Nevertheless, such differences are minute. What
matters is that both tables confirm that there is nothing fundamentally
wrong with the process in Figure 2.

Linear subgraphs, like the ones in Figure 5, with a degree sequence
consisting largely of ones, are suspect for two additional reasons.
Firstly, they may be the result of over-analytical thinking that
unnecessarily splits tasks in steps that should be combined. Secondly,
the absence of feedback arcs and other cross-connections suggests a
schematic interpretation of the real process that does not include all
options and constraints, i.e. narrow framing. To prevent decision taking
in narrow frames, it is advisable to avoid sequential procedures,
consisting of tasks each involving only one or two actors or
stakeholders and concerning decisions on a single issue or aspect.
Instead, decisions should be combined and made by larger groups. In a
design evaluation, for example, one should not first evaluate the design
for compliance to planning regulations, then to the building code, then
to the brief and finally to the budget. Instead, all checks should be
combined in a single evaluation that also includes the relations between
the three criteria (Figure 6): a discrepancy with respect to the brief
could be due to inescapable planning constraints, while additional costs
can incur as a result of design decisions that achieve more than what
the brief asks for. A combined evaluation therefore supports precise and
effective feedback to the cause of a problem, such as a request for
exemption from existing planning regulations because of the added value
of an energetically innovative solution that adds to the building
height.

design but still without feedback to the brief or budget, or evaluation

** Group processes
A frequent objection to combining decisions and evaluations is the
resulting complexity of the tasks (recognizable by the high in-degree of
the nodes). This objection is founded on the presumed efficiency of
simple tasks with narrow frames and ignores not only the dangers of
narrow framing but also the low effectivity and inefficiency of
sequential processes, especially if complex problems are artificially
parsed into long sequences. It also follows the dangerous tendency in
group decision making to put consensus above true solutions. In
meetings, for example, it is customary to start debating a problem
immediately and try reach a conclusion upon which all participants agree
as soon as possible. This allows the most vocal participants to dictate
the level and direction of the discussion. However, as we have seen,
these persons may be less knowledgeable than presumed and suffer from
illusions of confidence. They might therefore lead the discussion
astray, while more hesitant participants hide behind them and follow
their direction, creating a false feeling of rational alignment. It is
recommended that, instead of initiating a meeting with an immediate
debate towards general consensus, each participant should first prepare
and present a separate analysis of the problem and suggestions for its
solution. Informing each other in this manner is a more constructive and
inclusive basis for a discussion that compares or combines different
options, taking more aspects into account and considering them from more
perspectives.

This approach to group decision making reflects the differences between
Type 1 and Type 2 processes: for personal action, Type 1 thinking may
suffice but for joint action and interpersonal communication, especially
with respect to complex, partially shared goals (as in most AECO
processes), Type 2 reflective processes are required. The load-bearing
structure of a design can be decided in a flash of inspiration but
explaining it to the other members of a design team who have to adjust
to it, as well as estimating its effects (e.g. direct and indirect
costs) is clearly more analytical and time consuming. It is therefore
important that the process design ensures that actors arrive at combined
decisions adequately prepared, with complete plans, proposals, analyses
and evaluations, which are made available to all in time, before any
deliberation and decision. This makes all options explicit, creating a
broad frame and basing consensus on the comparison and combination of
options rather than the opinions and personalities of vocal
participants.

In a process diagram, this means that actors and stakeholders do not
give direct input to a decision node, as the client does in the faulty
example of Figure 3. That would imply a personal, possibly variable
opinion, e.g. that clients change their mind about what they want
without prior communication to other project participants. Instead,
actors and stakeholders should connect to decisions through the products
of their tasks, as the client does through the budget in Figure 2. A
decision should take place by comparing the different products, e.g. a
design to its brief and budget, and its outputs should include feedback
to these products: if clients change their minds, this should be
expressed clearly as adaptation of briefs, budgets etc. In graph terms,
this means that the distance of actors and stakeholders from decision
nodes should be at least 2.

In the same vein, task nodes do not output into actor or stakeholder
nodes. An arc leading from e.g. a design to a client, as in the
misleading diagram of Figure 3, does not mean that the design is given
to the client but that a client is selected on the basis of the design
--- in fact, a new client, different to the one who initiated the
process at the top of the diagram. A correct diagram would indicate that
the design is submitted to an evaluation of its compliance to the brief,
similarly to the comparison to the budget in Figure 2. The client is not
directly involved in this compliance evaluation. One should not confuse
the tasks in process diagrams with the social interactions that take
place around the tasks. The presence of clients in meetings on brief
compliance does not mean that the brief is ignored, only that the
compliance evaluation is communicated directly and transparently to the
clients.

The emphasis on tasks and their products in process diagrams is
important for solving problems in AECO. These problems are often
considered ill-defined and therefore hard to solve because there is no
clear agreement on the problem, its constraints and goals. This makes
difficult to agree on solutions and take joint decisions. By making
tasks and products explicit, any lack of agreement becomes clear to all
and nudges them towards less fuzzy problem descriptions and procedures.
There is, for example, no reason why a budget should not be specific and
transparent, calculated on the basis of clear parameters that can be
modified in response to the design or changing social, technological or
economic conditions.

** Illusions of confidence and skill
Process management is particularly sensitive to illusions of confidence
concerning self-assured participants or presumed experts. A clear
expression of these illusions are black boxes in a process: chunks that
are delegated to a particular actor without clear understanding of what
takes place there and uncertain relations to the rest of the process.
Such chunks are often claimed by specific disciplines, which makes the
selection of project participants for those disciplines quite sensitive.
Choosing them on the basis of track record is a positive development,
only marred by the lack of objective and reliable performance
measurements, which render any selection even more sensitive to
illusions of confidence and skill. It is quite hard to distinguish what
went well in previous projects thanks to a particular actor versus other
actors or contextual factors. In a successful project, practically
everyone claims credit for what went well. It is even more difficult to
establish what went wrong due to a specific actor, since very few are
brave enough to admit responsibility. In the end, all one can tell is
that some actors were involved in a project, that the project had a
certain performance and that some aspects were better than others. Such
vagueness does not free us from any illusion.

To safeguard a process we should therefore avoid delegating large
clusters of tasks to actors or stakeholders, turning them into black
boxes that are inevitably beyond control. Instead, a process description
should parse activities in as specific tasks as possible. For example,
rather than abstractly asking for a cost estimate, we should specify how
the cost estimate should be made: the prerequisites to making an
estimate (such as a design containing the necessary information), the
method used for the estimation, the timing of the estimate relative to
the rest of the process (making sure that the prerequisites can be met,
as well as that the estimate is directly used) and how the estimate
should be evaluated, including follow-up actions such as feedback to the
design. It goes without saying that bundling the design, the cost
estimation and the evaluation into a single node is unacceptable.
Equally dangerous is entrusting the subgraph containing all these tasks
to a single stakeholder.

A structured, analytical process is neither trivial nor insulting, even
to the greatest of experts, especially if the parsing of the black boxes
is based on their approach and facilitates their actions and
interactions with the rest of the process in a transparent and
operational framework. As for process managers, it is merely a matter of
good housekeeping and discipline that amounts to feedforward
(anticipating what might occur and establishing procedures for
prevention, early detection and immediate action), as opposed to
feedback (waiting until a problem emerges, deliberating about its
significance and finding ways to resolve it). Feedback as a means of
control seems inevitable in any process but feedforward greatly reduces
the need for feedback and, above all, the pressures associated with it.

** Narratives and coherence
A realistic diagram makes the process inclusive, empowering each
participant to track progress from their own perspective and identify
interactions with others. Process management benefits from
inclusiveness, too, because it becomes protected from the dangers of
one-sided narratives and the frictions and imbalances they can cause.
Instead of having a single narrative, from the perspective of a dominant
participant and possibly accepted due to a halo effect, the various
actors and stakeholders can project their own narratives on the process
design and so escape inside views and planning fallacies. In this way,
coherence is not apparent or imposed but real and constructed by all
participants together, resulting in scenarios that are realistic (i.e.
scenarios that may include conflicts and lacunae but also make them
clear to all) and combat /probability neglect:/ multiple perspectives
help give each risk the right consideration, so that big risks are not
ignored and small risks are not given too much weight (as is often the
case with inside views).

This also puts performance before compliance: rather than trying to stay
within the narrative, the process is driven towards the highest goals
attainable. For example, the budget in Figure 2 is based on assumptions
that may remain unchallenged if all that matters is that the design
conforms to the budget. If, on the other hand, these assumptions are
negotiable and adaptable to suggestions by project participants and
outcomes, then the process can lead to a better relation between costs
and performance.

To avoid straight-jacketing a process into a narrative, it is again
advisable to avoid sequential process designs. Most narratives,
certainly in AECO, tend to have a linear structure that imposes one
narrow frame after the other on the interpretation of a problem, cutting
it down into subproblems in a way that fits the coherence of the
narrative but not necessarily the needs of the project. Combined tasks
and parallel tracks can improve reliability, as well as effectivity, by
allowing each participant adequate scope for their activities and
priorities.

* Graph measures
As already mentioned, graph measures can be used to quantify indicators,
checks and controls, making them easier to implement in a process
diagram:

- Decisions nodes should have in- and out-degrees equal or higher than 2
- Linear, peripheral subgraphs with degree sequences of ones should have
  a length of 2
- Important tasks should be in the center
- Preparatory and external tasks should be in the periphery
- Actor and stakeholder nodes should have a distance of 2 from decision
  nodes

In addition to these:

- The degree of a node is a good indication of local complexity.
  - A high in-degree suggests complexity in information processing and
    decision making at the particular task, as well as dependence on
    multiple actors or previous tasks. If a high in-degree indicates a
    collection point, e.g. different specialists coming together to
    compile a brief, you should organize the resulting group processes
    with care without splitting the node into a sequence of tasks that
    gives the illusion of simplicity. On the other hand, if a node
    denotes an abstraction or agglomeration of too many tasks (e.g. a
    complete stage like concept design), its high degree should prompt a
    more analytical and explicit description of these tasks.
  - The out-degree indicates scope: how broad the effects of a task are
    or how widely a stakeholder is involved in the process. For example,
    it is expected that the products of a key task like briefing are
    used in many places in a process. But even if the significance of
    the task is low, a high out-degree means that many others may depend
    on its timely execution.
- Bridges indicate transitions from one part of the process to another
  (e.g. transition between stages), as well as connections that are
  sensitive to process delays or interruptions: if the transaction
  described by the arc does not take place, the whole process halts. A
  process diagram with many bridges usually describes a sequential or
  phased process. As processes with combined tasks and parallel tracks

  circulation but also presents opportunities for control, a bridge in a
  process diagram, even if unavoidable, should be coupled to actions
  that benefit the process and its management, e.g. synchronization of

* Information diagrams
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

/In this chapter we move from tasks to information by transforming the
process diagram into an information diagram: a digraph of information
instances and related actions and transactions. Information diagrams
represent the information side of management, which both operationalizes
and validates a process design. This chapter builds on the chapter on
process diagrams and presupposes knowledge of graphs, in particular
digraphs (see Appendix I). /

* Process operationalization
Process diagrams are essential for the social side of management: they
tell us who is doing what and when, in an overview that supports both
zooming in or out and tracking the contributions or interests of each
stakeholder. What they do not do is specify tasks in terms of content
and structure. For example, they tell us that we need a design to make a
cost estimate but not exactly what the design should contain, which
aspects of the design relate to costs, how these aspects are processed
towards a cost estimate and what should be included in the cost
estimate. Leaving this operationalization of the process design to the
discretion of the actors inevitably causes uncertainties and conflicts
that undermine the process and its management.

Translating the process diagram into information instances and actions
makes the individual tasks operational and unambiguous at a practical
level, so that every participant knows exactly what to expect and do.
This guides implementation and allows for evaluation and control
throughout the process. For example, a task like “calculate the net area
of a room” becomes a matter of obtaining a complete and truthful
description of the room, including all dimensions of the room as well as
of any obstacles that should be subtracted from it, making the necessary
calculations and producing either a total area measurement or an
analytical list of measurements that includes obstacles. At this level,
there is little if any room for omissions or misunderstandings and we
can easily ascertain if things are done correctly. The actor who makes
the calculation has clear expectations concerning the room description
another actor delivers and equally clear instructions as to how the
calculation results should be communicated. How the calculation is made
(with a computer, a calculator, an abacus or mentally) is usually a
matter for the actor, their capacities in relation to the demands of the
task and applicable professional standards.

Such specificity is necessary for the information side of management:
the guidance and control of a process on the basis of what actors
produce and consume in it. It is also essential with respect to
digitization: it ensures that the use of digital resources is meaningful
and constructive. Quite often digitization is managed by imposing
standards and restrictions on the means. For example, we can stipulate
that building designs should be made in BIM but this does not help
achieve the performance promised by BIM. We must also stipulate what
constitutes proper and acceptable usage of BIM. In fact, it should not
matter which software or approach is used if the requirements of the
deliverables are met: design representations with the right content and
a structure that facilitates retrieval and processing of this content.
An information diagram that bypasses all assumptions concerning
digitization means and approaches, and describes what should be done
with precision and accuracy not only supports IM but also explains why
e.g. BIM is required rather than CAD.

Finally, expressing a process in terms of specific information is
helpful in avoiding “mental shotgun” situations: when confronted with
unexpected problems, we tend to confound our Type 2 processes by
mentally computing too much information, clearly more than we need or is
relevant to the issues at hand. Panic is often the cause of the mental
shotgun, as well as its effect. To countermand this, we must be clear
not only concerning which data are relevant to each task but also how
these derive from primary data and how primary and derivative data are
structured in the representations we use. This facilitates
identification of pertinent information and its provenance even under
unforeseen circumstances, so that decisions can be taken and evaluated
without confusion or uncertainty.

* From process to information diagram: I-P-O
The transition from process to information diagram starts by
superimposing the I-P-O scheme on each task, with the P on the task node
(Figure 1). This expresses what takes place in the task in
information-processing terms by adding an input node before and an
output node after the task. Usually, the output of a task becomes direct
input to the following task, so only a single node needs to be added
between the two. Note that this is not always the case: the output of a
task may connect to more tasks, in ways not anticipated in the process
diagram. Similarly, the input of a task may merge the output of several
other tasks.

The process diagram may also miss nodes that describe external sources,
for example the published unit prices a cost specialist uses or
reference projects for the brief or budget. The same applies to the
outcomes of a process: design approval usually implies some information
deliverables, such as a representation of the approved design. These
nodes must be added to the information diagram, too.

In general, the transformation of a process diagram amounts to the
following graph operations:

- Subdivision of arcs to introduce nodes for their input and output
- Splitting  of process diagram sources to create nodes that represent
  the input to these tasks
- Splitting  of process diagram terminals to create nodes that represent
  the output of these tasks

Alternatively, the first point can be expressed more precisely as:

- Splitting of each task node twice to create one node for its input and
  one for its output
- Contraction of edges between input and output nodes that respectively
  have an in- and out-degree of 1

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. From process to information diagram: the I-P-O
scheme is superimposed on each task in the process diagram (middle),
resulting in an augmentation of the graph with a new source and
terminal, and an input/output node between the two tasks (right) /
[[file:media/assets/from-process-to-info.png]]

 

The input and output nodes in an information diagram must be made as
specific as possible. The design node in Figure 2 is expected to
contribute to a cost estimation involving gross floor areas. This means
that the design cannot exist solely in the architect's mind; we need
some external representation as input, on the basis of which we can
measure floor areas, moreover by use category (as these have different
unit prices). The obvious candidate is a floor plan and, more precisely,
one where all spaces are indicated and labelled by their use. This floor
plan rather than some abstract notion of a design is the appropriate
input for the processing we require (calculation of gross floor areas).
In the same manner, one can establish that these areas are the output of
a new task, as well as the input to the next processing step (cost
estimation).

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Cost estimation process diagram/
[[file:media/assets/cost-process-2.png]]

 

Figure 3 illustrates the results of the transformation. Between design
and cost estimation it was necessary to insert two nodes, so as to be
quite specific concerning the input to the cost estimation calculations.
Note that in this way some tasks are attached to the arcs: the
information diagram does not specify how the floor plan is produced from
the design or how the floor areas are calculated in the floor plan. This
is because emphasis is now firmly on /what/ (information); /how,/ as the
remit of the actors, is assumed to be known or standardized and, in any
case, constrained by the specified output. Similarly, the actor /
stakeholder nodes have been removed in order to put emphasis on task and
information nodes, as well as save space. In this version, who
determines the budget, who makes the design and who calculates the cost
estimate is implicit in their tasks and products but, at the same time,
unambiguous. If this is not the case and there are multiple actors or
stakeholders involved in different tasks with varying capacities, it is
advisable to keep them in the information diagram, too, so that there
can be no misunderstanding as to e.g. which designer or engineer is
responsible for each design aspect. Referring to the process diagram
concerning such matters is less practical; the information diagram
should be self-sufficient and self-explanatory.

The uniqueness rule applies to information diagrams, too: each object
should appear only once, as a single node. So, if the design must be
improved because the design is deemed too expensive, the diagram should
contain a feedback arc to the design. On the other hand, if the cost
evaluation leads to a radically new design, requiring a new node in the
diagram, then this should be made clear by means of unambiguous node
labelling (e.g. /Design 1/ and /Design 2/). Such new versions of the
same nodes should be used cautiously and sparingly, only when absolutely
necessary, e.g. when a process involves design alternatives. Feedback to
the floor plan is also possible but not if it is the design that must be
improved: any feedback to an information node is normally due to quality
issues, e.g. if the floor plan contains no indications of use type. Such
feedback is not part of process diagrams but information diagrams must
include controls of information quality, too.

The other two rules of process diagrams, the decision degrees and the
specificity and comprehensiveness rules, also apply to information
diagrams, even more strictly. What may be excused as pragmatic fuzziness
and abstraction in a process diagram is unacceptable and undermining in
an information diagram. For example, it is necessary in Figure 3 to
indicate that what is measured in the floor plan are the floor areas of
different uses because the cost estimation applies different unit prices
to each type of building use. One m^{2} of storage area costs
significantly less than one m^{2 }of office space, which in turn costs
less than one m^{2 }of an operating theatre in a hospital. This means
that it is not enough to calculate the total gross floor area of a
hospital design; one has to know the use of every space, so as to be
able to calculate the subtotals for each type. The subtotals are then
multiplied by the unit prices to arrive at a correct estimate and
ascertain which category may be too big or too costly. In an evaluation,
it is imperative that the things that are compared are similarly
unambiguously specified. If, for example, the hospital budget has
separate chapters for each use type, it should be clear how the
comparison takes place (e.g. per use type or per building part, which
may include various types).

The example illustrates the key differences between process and
information diagrams: the former can be abstract about what each task
entails and focus on process flow but the latter has to be specific
regarding information sources (e.g. which drawings are used), the
information instances these sources accommodate and the actions through
which these instances are processed. The higher specificity of
information diagrams leads to a finer grain in the analysis of the
process, resulting in nodes and arcs that allow one to be even more
precise and hence certain about information flow, as well as safeguard
information quality. While in general the flow is the same in both
diagrams, the higher specificity of the information diagram may lead to
new insights and local elaborations or changes in the process design.

One such elaboration is the analysis of the design node in the process
diagram into a sequence of nodes (design, floor plan, floor areas per
use type) in the information diagram. Such expansion is generally
necessary at critical points of a process. Similarly, in making an
information diagram one should pay particular attention to nodes with a
high in- or out-degree in the process diagram. These indicate tasks of
high complexity and density, which should possibly be analysed into
several tasks in the information diagram, provided that this does not
undermine parallel or integrated decision processes. As a rule of thumb,
the results of such an expansion in an information diagram should
include a large number of arcs between the new nodes, expressing the
complexity of the task represented by the original node.

* Information diagrams for BIM
Until now, we have discussed information diagrams as if we were in the
previous century, working with analogue representations and their
digital facsimiles. This is a far cry from the symbolic representations
that form the present and predictable future of digitization in AECO.
Adapting our example of the cost estimation to BIM means first of all
that the model (the central information system) should be explicitly
present in the diagram. This information system contains the symbols and
relations in which primary data are found. Derivative data like floor
area calculations are produced from the model and presented in views
like schedules. These schedules are typically predefined in various
formats, including room schedules that list spaces and their properties,
including floor area calculations (Figure 4).

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. Room schedule in a BIM editor/
[[file:media/assets/room-schedule-1024x768-1.png]]

 

Room schedules can be used to verify that the model contains all primary
data needed for the cost estimation, i.e. the spaces, their dimensions
and use types. They can also be expanded with unit prices and subsequent
calculations, thus integrating cost estimation in BIM in a
straightforward and transparent manner (Figure 5).

 

#+caption: /Figure 5. Room schedule with integrated cost estimation/
[[file:media/assets/cost-estimation-schedule-1-1024x766-1.png]]

 

Figure 6 is the information diagram for cost estimation in BIM.
Interestingly, it is not significantly different from Figure 3, only
feedback goes to the design representation rather than an abstract
design node. Collaboration in BIM means that information processed by
all actors resides permanently in a single, central representation. The
properties and relations of symbols that accommodate this information
cannot be detached from the representation, as was the custom with
analogue information carriers, where each discipline had its own
drawings of the same design. In BIM, any information action or
transaction starts from the model and is usually followed by feedback to
the model (with the exception of terminal nodes). This means that
feedback should be specific, i.e. directed at the space symbols in the
model, which could accommodate it as annotations or, preferably,
constraints on properties and relations. By being specific about which
symbols, properties and relations are affected, one can guide
information actions with precision and certainty, avoiding the dangers
of improvised interpretations by confused actors.

In general, any connection to a model in BIM, either output or input,
should refer to specific symbols rather than the representation in
general. For example, if an evaluation results in a decision to improve
the thermal insulation of a building, the feedback from the evaluation
should connect to the symbols of the particular building elements that
must be improved, such as the windows or the roof. Views in BIM, such as
schedules or floor plans, are for analysis and communication, hence
serve as output from the model or as environments for processing. Input
to the model (including feedback) should therefore not connect to views
but to symbols in the model. In this respect, it is advisable to
represent views in information diagrams in a way that reminds you that
they do not normally accept input.

In our example, the unit prices are connected to the model through a
schedule, i.e. a view: they do not become properties of space symbols.
The reasoning behind this choice is that unit prices are values that
relate to aggregates: sums that abstract the specific circumstances of
each symbol in order to approximate averages. As such, they are
derivative data that do not merit inclusion among the primary properties
of a symbol. Their connection to a view indicates that they are
temporarily linked to the model rather than integrated in it.

As an indication of the level of detail possible and frequently
necessary in IM, Figure 7 is a variation of the same information diagram
with a couple of information quality controls added. The controls
concern the presence of essential information (the space symbols) and
primary properties of these symbols (use type). Note that while the
diagram is specific about which symbols and properties are concerned, it
is elliptical about how the controls are implemented, leaving such
matters to the technical BIM specialists. In fact, the diagram violates
the decision degrees rule by missing one input in both control nodes.

* Tolerances
When translating tasks into information, we must often consider the
tolerances for each input or output. Care should be taken that these are
kept as narrow as possible. Wide tolerances are unacceptable as an
indication of either ignorance or unwarranted uncertainty. As a result,
they offer no sound basis for decision making. For example, a tight time
planning compels us to pay more attention to the requirements and
feasibility of each step, as well as to how dependencies between tasks
are ordered in time. Reversely, vagueness about deadlines and milestones
promotes procrastination and deferment of decisions, especially
concerning steps about which we are less clear.

* Testing information diagrams
Information diagrams should be tested from the perspective of each actor
and stakeholder, in the same way as process diagrams. The only
difference is that the relation of an actor or stakeholder to each node
should be specified in terms of input, output and processing: if the
task (the processing) should be undertaken by the particular actor, for
example the design by the architect, they should verify their capacity
to undertake it and help with the specification of the necessary input,
e.g. a budget, a brief and a site description (including applicable
building codes and planning regulations). The same holds for the output:
the content, structure and timing of information produced in the task
should be agreed in unambiguous terms. Specifying where this information
is used and by whom should be avoided in order to prevent deterministic,
reductionist adaptations (e.g. “if they need it only for this cost
estimation, I don't have to worry about aspects other than floor
areas”).

Tracking the involvement of each actor and stakeholder is done in the
same way as in process diagrams, with subgraphs and directed walks, and
afterwards a board-game-like simulation for the whole group of actors
and stakeholders. In the group simulation, it is especially important to
reach general agreement about the input and output of each task, as well
as about the custodianship of information: it is not enough to know who
is the author of some information; who takes care of it at different
stages of the process is not necessarily the same, obvious to all or
automatic. In the context of BIM, moreover, a distinction should be made
concerning care for the technical aspects of a model (which can be
delegated to digitization specialists) and the content of symbols and
relations (which remains a responsibility of process stakeholders).

Finally, once an information diagram is finalized, one should consider
the semantic type of information used as input in any task: if it is
derivative, it should be possible to track it back to the primary data
from which it is produced. Floor areas are derivative, so we must be
able to identify the primary data from which they derive in the
information diagram, as well as the representations that accommodate
these primary data.

* Graph measures
The graph measures used to analyse process diagrams obviously also apply
to information diagrams. The significance and meaning of degrees,
bridges, distances, closeness, centers and peripheries are the same in
both. Differences tend to be subtle and primarily reflect the shift of
attention from tasks to information. For example, while a node denoting
designing is central in a process diagram, it is the node of the design
representation (e.g. the BIM model) that takes central position in the
information diagram. Being more analytical and specific, information
diagrams also have a larger size and order than their process
counterparts. This makes graph drawing and legibility more difficult,
and requires more careful analysis and measurement. A useful strategy is
to consider each part of the process in its own subgraph, without
neglecting arcs that connect nodes in different subgraphs. To make
certain that no such connection is obscured, any analysis in subraphs
should be followed by analysis of the whole graph. One should always
keep in mind that any partial consideration of a process is simply for
reasons of convenience and not subdivide the process in artificially
distinct modules. If a process in truly modular, then each module should
be treated as a separate process in order to verify its
self-sufficiency.

* Process validation
Information diagrams are more than an operational version of process
diagrams. Their utility extends to the validation of process designs: it
establishes whether the processes can deliver what they are expected to.
When we translate each task and relation into information-processing
actions, operationalization predictably stumbles upon hidden problems,
making lacunae and inconsistencies obvious by the inability to obtain or
produce the necessary information. For example, the calculation of the
net area of a room presupposes a detailed, accurate representation that
includes obstacles. Therefore, it is not attainable if the available
representation is a floor plan sketch with only a rough description of
the shape of the room and its dimensions. By showing exactly how each
task is performed, information diagrams validate individual tasks but
also address consistency and coherence more accurately than process
diagrams: they show if all tasks are organized in the same way, with
workable connections between them and with the expected final
deliverables. In the above example, the mismatch between the net area
calculation and the floor plan can indicate a premature use of a precise
technique, a delay in design or a haphazard management approach
resulting in more incompatibilities and disharmonies.

Validation is not merely technical; it also targets many of the
cognitive issues discussed in the previous chapter. Even the best
process designs remain subject to the biases that characterize Type 1
processes. It is always possible that erroneous assumptions and vague
specifications have slipped in and populate the process description,
unnoticed by project participants who share the same biases. The
specificity of information diagrams helps make the cautions about
cognitive limitations and their possible effects on process diagrams
stronger and easier to identify on the basis of clear cues.

Eradication of Type 1 biases and illusions that have escaped scrutiny is
founded on the cognitive decoupling supported by information diagrams.
Even though the process and the information diagram appear quite
similar, they are quite different in contect and abstraction level. The
process diagram represents tasks in a way that is more rigorous than
conventional process descriptions but essentially in similar terms. The
information diagram shifts attention to the input and output of these
tasks, and so forms a departure from the descriptions we usually apply
to a process. Moreover, it supports Type 2 algorithmic processes by
making such input and output explicit, often quantitative and
unambiguously linked to actions and transactions.

The most obvious cue about biases in the process design is inability to
obtain or produce the necessary information, as in the above example of
a net area calculations. If the process diagram has been carefully set
up, this suggests more than a local problem and should make us critical
about what we think we know: illusions of knowledge may have resulted in
grey areas that make connections between tasks uncertain. This combats
overconfidence in the beliefs behind the process design and reveals
biases in our expectations from it, so that predictable mistakes (often
caused by adherence to customary or conventional procedures) can be
avoided. As for unpredictable mistakes, information diagrams help reduce
their error margins and anchor decisions around realistic, transparently
derived values.

Many problems are caused by the substitution of a demanding task by a
simpler one that does not deliver the necessary performance or output.
Any instances of inappropriate substitution in the process design can be
identified and removed on the basis of the following criteria:

- /Precision and accuracy requirements:/ rather than accepting existing
  practices, consider what each task actually needs in order to achieve
  the highest possible performance. Compromises that reduce this
  performance may be inevitable but try to make them only when
  necessary.
- /Information availability and processing capacity:/ basing a cost
  estimate on the floor area of a design may be acceptable when little
  is yet known about the design but doing so with a full simulation of
  the construction process at your disposal makes no sense. So, when
  translating a task into information instances, always consider what is
  already available in the process (information and processing tools),
  in particular with respect to the precision requirements of each task.

Any illusions of cause that may have persisted in the process diagram
are generally easy to detect, as precedence in time (as in e.g. a time
schedule) does not translate into connections of information output and
input in the information diagram. In particular, information diagrams
help identify the true causes of problems by tracking the derivation of
information. For example, a mismatch between the load-bearing structure
and the required span widths for rooms is not necessarily due to poor
decision making concerning the load-bearing structure. It might also
derive from vagueness or inconsistencies in the brief or from
inappropriate cost constraints on the structure (i.e. inconsistencies
between brief and budget).

Focusing on information is a good antidote to change and inattentional
blindness, too: it is hard to ignore what is available, expected or
required at any step in a process. This also subverts any narrow focus
by being inclusive and comprehensive by necessity, while removing
opportunities to add fictitious information that does not come from a
specific internal or external source. The coherence and consistency that
can be achieved with information diagrams is important for avoiding
planning and sunken-costs fallacies: being specific on information
leaves even less room for illusions of knowledge and confidence.
Finally, information diagrams help develop an outside view of the
project by making clear the connections between internal information to
external sources, including through /reference class forecasting/:
references to relevant classes of projects, reliable statistics on these
projects and baseline forecasts from these statistics that are adapted
to the characteristics of the particular
case.[[#chapter-010-information-diagrams.xhtml#footnote-44-1][^{[1]}]]
The development of reference classes may initially seem daunting but it
is something any enterprise or professional body can do if projects are
properly documented.

Despite its rigour, validation at the information level is less
confrontational than at the process level. Challenging suspect parts in
a process description with general facts, principles and opinions leads
to discussions that can be dismissed merely because they conflict with
basic assumptions (“we've always made our budgets this way”). Expressing
the process in terms of information actions and transactions returns
more objective, comprehensive and practical arguments why a process may
or may not deliver the expected results. The discussion consequently
shifts from general principles to how and which information is processed
with respect to stated goals, such as delivering a building with the
required qualities and performance on time and within budget.

* Veracity
An important aspect of validation concerns the veracity of information.
The problem is that, even without the halo effect, our natural tendency
is to believe that others are telling the truth. Defaulting to truth
makes sense for the economy and efficiency of communication, which would
suffer if we were to test the veracity of all incoming information. We
are suspicious of others only when we expect them to deceive us.
Suspicion is often triggered by the demeanour of the information sender
but unfortunately this is a very poor indicator. We become suspicious of
nervous presenters who look away and mumble, paying too much attention
to the delivery rather than the content. Suspicions about the intentions
of others are much more reliable but they do not normally arise in
reasonably harmonious projects. Given sufficient trust, which is
reinforced by inside views, actors and stakeholders routinely default to
truth, failing to detect inconsistencies that undermine the veracity of
information they receive. We are alert to inconsistencies only in
projects that have experienced adversities such that cast doubt on the
integrity or intentions of others but by then the project may be beyond
saving.

Relying on the actual content of communication is more reliable and
quite
accurate.[[#chapter-010-information-diagrams.xhtml#footnote-44-2][^{[2]}]]
If information is self-contradictory or inconsistent with known facts,
it is easier to evaluate it and develop controls that anticipate
unexpected problems. Switching from task to information therefore
facilitates the integration of veracity controls in a process, usually
as preliminary evaluations of information before important decisions or
actions. For example, prior to analysing construction costs we should
check the veracity of information input in the estimation. This involves
tracing the primary data from which this information derives, as well as
checking how it is derived. If the information is derived from
contradictory of irrelevant sources, e.g. from a different design or an
earlier version, this can be both easily detected and directly
corrected. If the derivation involves questionable procedures, e.g.
measurements of a supposedly typical part of the design only, these too
can be detected and adjusted.

* Information diagrams in information management
An information diagram that captures both the needs of a process and the
capacities of BIM can make IM clear and unambiguous to both managers and
actors in the process. Information flow is explicitly depicted in the
diagram, especially concerning what, who and when. Managers can use the
information diagram to guide and control the process at any moment,
while actors have a clear picture of the scope and significance of their
actions. Addressing /how/ questions depends on the fineness of the grain
in the description of information instances: the finer it is, the more
specific answers one can draw from the diagram. As such specificity
affects interpretation, care should be taken to balance the two: many
actors in a building project are knowledgeable professionals who may not
take kindly to IM approaches that overconstrain their actions.

On the other hand, IM has to be strict about matters of authorship and
custodianship because not everybody is yet accustomed to the
possibilities and responsibilities of digital information processing. By
linking stakeholders to information with accordingly labelled arcs in
the information diagram, one can indicate responsibilities and actions
throughout a process. Note that roles can be variable: an actor who
authors some information in one task may become custodian of other
information in another task.

Concerning information quality, the information diagram forms a usable
background for pragmatic value: applying the I‑P‑O scheme at any node is
a critical part of measuring it, i.e. establishing what users need to
process and must produce in a task. Similarly, the information diagram
is essential for the evaluation of completeness, coherence and
consistency in BIM: any output from the model and especially any
feedback to it is an opportunity to identify violations and conflicts
that affect these aspects.

Information diagrams are also essential for our parsimonious approach to
information quality. The approach focuses on primary data and their
propagation; both can be traced with accuracy in the diagram, including
explicit, manageable connections to derivative data. This enables
managers and other project participants to know what should be preserved
or prioritized. Finally, in the same manner one can identify anti-data,
on the basis of expectations (e.g. knowing when information from
different disciplines comes together in a process) and interpretation
(e.g. that a space without a door is a shaft). This leads to directed
action (e.g. requiring that two disciplines work together to solve
interfacing problems), which should be present in an information diagram
of appropriate specificity.

Above all, information diagrams illustrate the importance of IM for
managing processes and products: information flow and quality are not
technical issues but essential parts of any process, with direct
relevance for specific problems and related decisions. Requiring
complete, coherent, consistent and true information for a task is purely
for the successful completion of the task. Any requirements on
information, including syntactic ones, draw from project needs,
including the drive towards avoiding cognitive biases and illusions.
This confirms IM as a core part of any management approach, especially
with respect to digitization and its promise for decision support.

*** Key Takeaways
- /Information diagrams operationalize and validate process diagrams by
  translating them into information-processing actions and products /
- /The validation of process designs with information diagrams includes
  addressing cognitive biases and illusions /
- /The superimposition of the/ /I‑P‑O/ /scheme/ /on process task nodes
  helps translate a process diagram into an information diagram/
- /Information diagrams should take into account the implementation
  environment of BIM: the symbols and relations that contain the primary
  data and the views that present derivative data, as well as the
  possibilities for quality control/

*** Exercises
1. Compare the graph measures of Figure 2 to those of Figure 3: which
   differences do you observe and what are their causes and significance
   for the process design?
2. Add symbols, properties and relations to the information diagram of
   Figure 6 (especially with respect to feedback). Does the increased
   specificity make IM easier or more reliable?
3. Add actors to the information diagram of Figure 6. How does the
   result compare to Figure 2 (also in terms of graph measures)?
4. Complete Figure 7 by specifying how quality controls are performed
   (correct the diagram with respect to the decision degrees rule).
5. Make an information diagram for Figure 6 in the previous chapter (the
   “more comprehensive process diagram”).

* Exercise I: Maintenance
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

* The brief
Organize the process of repainting all walls in a large lecture hall at
a university. The walls are in good condition, so a single coat of pain
suffices. The process therefore can be reduced to the following tasks:

- Make a model of the lecture hall in BIM using direct measurements and
  photographs
- Classify wall surfaces and their parts with respect to:
  - Labour (e.g. painting parts narrower than 30 cm are more time
    consuming)
  - Equipment (e.g. parts higher than 220 cm require scaffolding)
  - Accessibility (e.g. parts behind radiators or other fixed obstacles
    are hard to reach and therefore also time consuming)
- Measure the wall surfaces
- Make cost estimates
- Make a time schedule in 4D BIM

* Deliverables
1. Process and information diagrams, accompanied by short explanatory
   comments
2. Basic model of the lecture hall in a BIM editor
3. Schedules for classification, measurement, estimates and scheduling
   in BIM

* Evaluation criteria
1. The process diagrams should:
   1. Make all actors, stakeholders and tasks explicit
   2. Include feedback loops in decision making

      estimates
   2. Allow to detect how information is derived from primary data
3. The model in BIM should contain:
   1. All relevant symbols
   2. All necessary equipment
   3. The necessary subdivisions of surfaces with respect to labour
      (tip: these are often determined by relations between symbols,
      e.g. wall to scaffold height)

* Exercise II: Change management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

* The brief
Organize how changes to a design in the development and realization
stages can be registered and processed in BIM. These changes may refer
to:

- Change to a property of a symbol (e.g. lengthening of a wall)
- Change of the type of a symbol (e.g. change of family for a door)
- Change in a relation between symbols (e.g. relocation of a door in a
  wall)
- Change in a time property of a symbol (e.g. as a result of a
  scheduling change)

Organize the process of change management in both stages as a series of
tasks that reflect the above types of changes and take into account
possible causes of change, such as:

- Changes in the brief (e.g. new activities added)
- Changes in the budget (e.g. increase of façade cost necessitating
  reduction of cost elsewhere)
- Changes in an aspect of the design (e.g. change in the heating
  solution or the fire rating of internal doors and ensuing interfacing
  issues -- not just clash detection)
- Changes in the construction schedules (e.g. due to delays in the
  delivery of components or to bad weather)
- Errors in construction (e.g. wrong dimensioning or specifications of
  an element)

* Deliverables
1. Process and information diagrams, accompanied by short explanatory
   comments
2. Basic model in a BIM editor demonstrating the way changes can be
   implemented

* Evaluation criteria
1. The process diagrams should:
   1. Make all actors, stakeholders, tasks and their relations explicit
   2. Include feedback loops for controlling the changes and their
      effects
2. The information diagrams should:
   1. Indicate which symbol properties and relations change, and how
   2. Allow to detect how changes are propagated from one symbol to
      another
3. The model in BIM should contain:
   1. Relevant examples for each kind of change
   2. Schedules that allow tracking of changes

If the exercise is a group assignment, consider roles for the following
aspects:

* Exercise III: Circularity for existing buildings
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

* The brief
The existing building stock in the Netherlands has to undergo extensive
improvements, so as to meet new user or environmental requirements, from
hybrid working and effective cooling to the energy transition. To reduce
costs, one can adopt a circular approach to both components or materials
released from existing buildings and the new components and subsystems
that will be added to the buildings. Organize the following tasks for a
typical Dutch single-family house:

- Document the existing situation in a model appropriate for renovation,
  i.e. including realization phases, distinction between existing and
  planned, what should remain and what should be removed
- Identify in the model components and materials that should be
  extracted (e.g. radiators: the house will switch to underfloor
  heating), explaining how identification takes place (preferably
  automatically) in the model
- Estimate the expected circularity form for these components and
  materials (recycle, remanufacture, repurpose, re-use etc.), explaining
  which factors play a role (weathering, wear, interfacing with other
  elements etc.) and how these factors can be detected in the model
- Identify which elements should be upgraded and specify what this
  entails in the model (paying attention to phasing and element type
  changes)
- Specify how new elements (for any renovation) should be added to the
  model to support the above in the remaining lifecycle of the house
- Make a time schedule for a renovation in 4D BIM

* Deliverables
1. Process and information diagrams, accompanied by short explanatory
   comments

   solutions
3. Schedules for circularity analyses in BIM

1. The process diagrams should:
   1. Make all actors, stakeholders and tasks explicit
   2. Include demolition as an option, with clear feasibility criteria
   3. Include feedback loops in decision making
   4. Have no unnecessary bridges
2. The information diagrams should:
   1. Indicate which classes of symbols and which types of properties
      and relations are relevant
   2. Allow to track how decisions are based to primary data
   3. Explain how circularity relates to information, e.g. which
      properties and relations are used to estimate it
3. The model in BIM should contain:
   1. A clear indication of how circularity (as derivative information)
      is described for each symbol
   2. A reliable solution for the time dimension, e.g. phases with clear
      connections, including precedence
   3. An efficient way of achieving overview, e.g. identifying all
      similar or interconnected components in an existing or projected
      situation

* Exercise IV: Energy transition
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

* The brief
In the Netherlands, as in many other countries, there are far-reaching
plans for reducing the energy consumption required by housing, such as
the envisaged energy transition
([[https://www.government.nl/topics/renewable-energy/central-government-promotes-energy-savings]],
[[https://www.iea.org/reports/the-netherlands-2020]]). Despite the wide
acceptance of the necessity of energy reduction and climate improvement,
these plans meet with opposition, reluctance,  operational complexity
and failure.  Particularly painful are cases where apparently
straightforward improvements, such as the placing of solar panels on
roofs, turn out to be a waste of public and private investment.
Practically all websites on solar panels are clear about the required
conditions, such as roof size and orientation. Still, as any walk
through a Dutch town or suburb reveals, there are many, presumably
subsidized, panel configurations that are too small or improperly
oriented, delivering only around 25% of the expected performance. This
even happens in new construction, which suggests that the reasons for
failure are deep and significant.

A wise municipality acknowledges the immensity of the task and, rather
than rushing into action and wasting time and money in questionable
procedures and unproductive subsidies, wants to start from understanding
the possibilities and limitations for the /existing/ housing stock: how
can they ascertain what can be done with each individual residential
building, which retrofit packages apply to different categories in the
municipality and what the costs and performance of energetic
refurbishments can be.

To this effect, they hire you to manage the process of information
collection, with the following brief:

1. Determine which information is necessary for each existing
   residential building: what we need to know to evaluate the existing
   situation, determine which improvements are required or possible and
   estimate the costs and effects of these improvements. The information
   should be explicitly linked to parts of the building, such as
   components in the building envelope and the building services. In
   addition to building information, also consider the usage of
   buildings (activities deployed in them, type of occupants, energy
   consumption).
2. Decide how this information should be organized in BIM, so that there
   is a complete and reliable model of each building in the
   municipality: which symbols, properties and relations accommodate the
   information in the model. Assume that there is affordable and
   reliable storage for the models.
3. Design a process for collecting data about each dwelling in a way
   that the information in BIM is permanently up to date. The
   municipality does not want to be burdened with the costs of
   periodical visits to every building, in which some expert inspects
   and documents what has changed since the last visit. They prefer to
   have an automatic system that connects to all relevant sources,
   stakeholders and actors, from the drawing in the archives of
   architectural offices to maintenance activities such as replacing a
   window pane. They want all involved parties to have access to the
   model of a building, be supported by the information it contains and,
   in return, update it with the results of their actions (e.g. change
   the type and construction year of the window panel).
4. Explain how the collection of models could help with the development
   of retrofit packages for the whole building stock in the municipality
   and how these packages could be matched to specific properties (e.g.
   how insulation needs in the building stock can be clustered into
   types and matched to solutions). This should be the foundation of
   municipal strategies for energetic improvement and is perhaps the
   most important product of the project (its culmination from the
   perspective of the client).

* Exercise V: Waste management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: chapter-title
  :END:

* The brief
Buildings are often consider as a major secondary source of valuable
materials, such as
metals.[[#chapter-015-waste-management-in-kitchen-or-bathroom-refurbishments.xhtml#footnote-194-1][^{[1]}]]
However, these materials are not easily or frequently released. In fact,
buildings prolong the in-use life of many materials, primarily because
of the longevity of buildings: rather than replace buildings in
relatively short cycles, as we do with e.g. cars or computers, we tend
to preserve them, often for longer than originally intended, mending and
fixing what still functions, even if performance is low.

This suggests that renovation and refurbishment rather than demolition
may be the main release of materials from buildings. Kitchen and
bathroom renovations, for example, are quite popular and frequent in
many countries. Unfortunately, they are less rigorously regulated than
demolition, also concerning waste production and management. A local
authority wants to change this in a manner that provides reliable
insights into the quantities and quality of materials released. To this
effect, they need an information strategy for:

- Making explicit the quantities and qualities of materials released by
  renovations and refurbishments, starting with kitchens and bathrooms.
- Making reliable estimates of the circularity level of released
  materials, from reuse to recycling.
- Stimulating efficient and effective waste management by both enabling
  secondary material makers and imposing different disposal rates for
  different kinds of building waste.

To help the local authority achieve these goals, you are asked to
develop a BIM-based process that will be compulsory for all building
renovations and refurbishments. This process should include:

1. A clear description of the existing situation (current phase)
2. A precise account of what is to be taken out of a kitchen or bathroom
   (extraction phase)
3. The exact process of extraction, from deconstruction to local
   demolition (important for the quality and reusability of components,
   as well as for the cost)
4. Guarantees that no hibernating materials or pollutants are left in
   the building
5. A precise specification of all new components to be added to the
   kitchen or bathroom (construction phase)
6. Expectations for waste management in future renovations and
   refurbishments (how the new components will help higher extraction
   rates or circularity levels)
7. Arguably the most important for your client: a way of connecting
   information on individual cases to strategic management and policy
   making for the whole municipal stock

Note that the overarching goal of the project is not to promote specific
circularity approaches but to provide unambiguous and reliable
information that helps understand the potential and feasibility of any
approach to waste management, sustainability and circularity. To this
end, your process design should include the ability to handle
uncertainty and vagueness, as well as the ability to remove them.

* Epilogue
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: back-matter-title
  :END:

Every book deserves a concluding part. In some genres, like novels and
thrillers, the whole book works towards a conclusion that terminates the
readers' journey and brings all narrative strands neatly together.
Others have more difficulty with the ending, for example textbooks that
deal with a series of subjects, like this one. A common practice in such
books is to write a conclusion in the style of scientific papers:
essentially a copy of the introduction, only with answers instead of
questions --- essentially a summary of key points made in the
intervening chapters. This works well in papers, even if the summary is
a mere list of points, but books require more coherence: a story, not a
list. Therefore, it often leads to selective narratives that
discriminate against some aspects. It is perhaps not accidental that
introductions and conclusions are the most read sections in scientific
papers, while prologues and epilogues are the least read chapters in
scientific books.

I shall keep my summary brief:

#+begin_quote
  /Thanks to digitization, we are producing and processing huge
  quantities of information for practically everything we do. This will
  become even more intensive in the foreseeable future, making
  information management (IM) a key concern in our personal and private
  lives. The significance of IM is acknowledged in AECO but AECO remains
  attached to outdated, analogue practices that are replicated in
  digital environments, distorting digitization and restricting its
  potential./

  /To improve the situation, we need to understand that digital
  representations like BIM are symbolic and start thinking in terms of
  symbols, properties, relations and the graphs they form instead of
  views like drawings and implementation mechanisms like lines. We must
  also approach information from a semantic perspective and realize that
  our main focus should be the primary data that define symbols and
  relations in our representations, and from which other data derive.
  This makes the two priorities of IM, information flows and information
  quality, means for the preservation of primary data and the
  transparent definition of derivative data./

  /To achieve these goals, we need to represent processes, too, as
  directed graphs of tasks and information processed around these tasks.
  The duality of process and information diagrams matches the social and
  information sides of management, and stimulates Type 2 thinking,
  through which we can prevent AECO failures and improve decision
  making./
#+end_quote

Is this summary sufficient? It certainly encapsulates the main message
of the book and should be clear enough to its readers. The problem is
that this message may fail to connect to other messages students and
professionals receive in abundance with respect to information and
digitization, for example the extensive push of BIM as a panacea, the
apparently impending transition to the magic of digital twins, golden
threads, AI, smart buildings and cities: a never-ending procession of
easy, automatic solutions that seem to be directly available.

The sad truth is that there are no easy solutions in information or
digitization. The promise of a solution may be simple to describe
(narratives, again) but, as anyone who has attempted anything
substantial in any digital environment can affirm, everything comes at
considerable cost and effort. All those things we take for granted on
the Internet or on our smartphones hide behind them expensive
infrastructures, set up in longer periods and with more failures than we
care to imagine. They are often still problematic, as we can see from
e.g. the  environmental impact of the colossal data centres that have
become a necessity for maintaining our hybrid lives.

As for AECO, its existing digital technologies may be not good enough
both for its needs and in comparison to what is generally available.
More worryingly, our use of these tools may be even worse. This suggests
that digitization in AECO, including BIM and other promising
technologies, is in a crisis but the crisis is not evident to the world
and perhaps not that important. After all, we still manage to produce
large, complex buildings, as well as large volumes of buildings, which
are snapped up by a willing market, at prices higher than ever. We can
see that in the current housing situation in the Netherlands: both
demand and prices are high, as is supply --- only supply is not as high
as demand. There are several ways to raise production volumes but, if
demand keeps growing, it is questionable that supply will ever satisfy
it. In fact, it may be rather undesirable.

Demand and cost are not limited to having a roof over one's head: we are
spending more and more on our buildings, heating, cooling and
refurbishing them with a regularity and to standards that would have
astounded previous generations. This obviously improves living quality
(although we have so far failed to address the environmental factors in
the COVID-19 spread) but also generates a lot of economic activity
around the built environment that keeps several industries in good
health. Our ways may be wasteful but somehow we manage to pay for them,
making everybody happy. Why then should digitization and IM matter and
to whom?

The answer is that they should matter to AECO professionals because they
have yet to enjoy the full potential of digitization either for easing
their burdens of for improving their performance. And they are not bound
to find enjoyment if all that happens is that new software and new
technologies like blockchains and digital twins become available to
them. What they need above all is rational approaches, founded on clear
principles that explain problems in full and guide solutions. Once we
have and understood them, finding the right implementation tools or even
learning to live with less than optimal solutions becomes easy and
productive. This is not insignificant for an industry widely accused of
underperformance.

Beyond their general impact, these new, rational approaches are an
opportunity for the new generations of professionals that enter the AECO
ranks, yet unfettered by its conventions and accustomed to more advanced
digitization in their private lives. These new professionals need to
find their place in a competitive world, full of elders with more
practical experience and wider networks. Meaningful, productive
digitization can help them as a specialization that is relatively
scarce, as well as a powerful means for achieving other, social or
economic goals.

What this book tries to convey is the core of such an approach, which
will not age as fast as the various kinds of software AECO has been
using and will therefore serve its users for longer and better than the
usual stuff that passes for computer literacy. Knowing how to use this
or that program is of little significance in decision making. AECO
professionals need to start from what they want to achieve with
digitization, instead of what is possible or customary with existing
software.

* Appendix I: Graph theory
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CLASS: back-matter-title
  :END:

* Undirected graphs
Graphs are mathematical structures that describe relations between pairs
of things. They can be represented by diagrams, where a /vertex/ stands
for a thing and an /edge/ for a relation between two things. In the
graph of a family tree, for example, the vertices represent the family
members and the edges their relationships (Figure 1). Any part of the
graph, for example, the nuclear family of father, mother, child and
their relations to each other, is a /subgraph. /Two vertices
are /adjacent/ if they are joined by an edge. The two vertices
are /incident/ with this edge and the edge is incident with both
vertices.

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. A family tree as a graph/
[[file:media/assets/family-tree-1.png]]

 

Graph diagrams are dimensionless: the size of a vertex and the length of
an edge do not matter either for the vertex and edge or for the whole
graph. The /size/ of a graph is measured by the number of edges in it,
while the number of vertices is the /order /of the graph. This means
that different arrangements of the vertices and edges in a graph drawing
are equally acceptable, so long as they follow a logic that helps
legibility (Figure 2). The graphs in Figure 1 and 2 are
/isomorphic: /they have the same vertices and, whenever a pair of
vertices in either graph is connected by an edge, the same also holds
for the other graph.

The main concern with graph diagrams is that care should be taken that
edges do not cross each other in the drawing because this indicates that
the graph is /planar. /Planar graphs have mathematical advantages that
relate to the subject of this book (representation of buildings and
processes), so you must try and draw your graphs in a way that
demonstrates this. Note that a graph may be planar even if you are
unable to find an arrangement where no edges intersect. Graph drawing
remains a hard task, even with computers. To ensure legibility, do the
following in your graphs:

- Arrange the nodes in a logical manner (e.g. in columns, rows or other
  clusters), without worrying for the size of the drawing or the length
  of the edges
- Try to have no crossing or overlapping edges, again without worrying
  about the resulting length or shape of the edges

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. The same family tree and graph/
[[file:media/assets/family-tree-2-e1637938741282.png]]

 

Properties (including size) can be attached to vertices and edges as
labels (textual or visual). The edges of the family tree are labelled
with the relationship between the persons represented by the vertices
they connect. The default relationship between parent and child is left
unlabelled. In general, it is recommended that you use textual labelling
rather than visual because it simplifies graph drawing and reading.

Graphs can also be described by adjacency matrices, in which each cell
contains the connection between the vertex in the row and the vertex in
the column. Table 1 shows if there is a direct connection between the
two family members (usually a first-degree relationship). Table 2 shows
the relationship as labelled in the graph. Table 2 therefore conveys
exactly the same information as the graph drawing, only in a different
form.

#+caption: /Table 2. Adjacency matrix of the family tree graph
(labelled)/

 

Each vertex in a graph has a /degree/: the number of edges connected to
it. In the family tree example, each grandparent and child vertex has a
degree of 3, the mother vertex 4 and the father vertex 6. The former
wife, whose parents do not appear in the graph, has a degree of only 2.
The degree of a node is a good indication of its importance or
complexity. In this case, it is logical that the father node has the
highest degree because the family tree focuses on his former and current
marital situation. An /odd/ vertex is one with a degree that is an odd
number, while the degree of an /even/ vertex is even. A vertex with a
degree equal to zero is called /isolated, /while a vertex with a degree
of 1, as the end stations in the metro map from the chapter on symbolic
representation (vertices A, H, G and N in Figure 3), is called a /leaf/.

The /degree sequence/ of a graph is obtained by listing the degrees of
vertices in a graph. This is particularly useful for identifying heavily
connected subgraphs. In a metro map, for example, it shows not only
which vertices are busy interchanges but also their proximity and
distribution: which parts of a line present the most opportunities for
changing to other lines.

 

#+caption: /Figure 3. The graph of a metro map/
[[file:media/assets/metro_labelled.png]]

 

A graph in /connected/ if each of its vertices connects to every other
vertex by some sequence of edges and vertices (a /walk/). The graphs in
this book are by definition connected: in a building there is
practically always a way to go from one place to another, while
processes should be characterized by continuity from beginning to end.
In fact, we pay particular attention to interruptions of connectedness,
such as bridges and minimal cuts. A /bridge/ is an edge that divides a
graph into two separate parts, so its removal renders the graph
/disconnected/. In the family tree, no edge is a bridge. If an edge is
removed from it, there are always a connection between two family
members it connected. For example, if the two children sever direct
communication between them, there is always the possibility to
communicate via the father or, more indirectly, through the rest of the
family. Such /bridgeless graphs/ hold advantages for communication and
continuity: a metro map that is a bridgeless graph means that passengers
can reach their destination, even when the connection between two
stations is disrupted. In this respect, our metro example is poor: in
Figure 3, all edges are bridges. The removal of any edge causes an
interruption in one of the two metro lines (Figure 4) and makes the
graph disconnected.

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. The removal of a bridge renders a graph
disconnected: vertices F and G are now connected only to each other/
[[file:media/assets/metro_labelled_disconnected.png]]

 

To disconnect the family tree, you need to remove a number of edges: a
/cut set/. The smallest such set is called the /minimum cut/. In our
example, the minimum cut consists of the two edges incident to the
former wife vertex (Figure 5). If these are removed, the vertex becomes
isolated. The number of edges in the minimum cut is the /edge
connectivity/ of the graph.

 

#+caption: /Figure 5. The minimum cut in the family tree graph/
[[file:media/assets/family-tree-minimum-cut-1.png]]

 

A walk that connects two vertices without any repetition in either the
edges or the vertices is called a /path. /For example, in Figure 1, the
maternal grandmother vertex connects to the child vertex through the
path consisting of the parent-child edge to the mother vertex, the
mother vertex and the parent-child edge from there to the child vertex.
This is also the /shortest path/ between the two vertices, shorter than
e.g. paths via the father and former wife vertices.

* Graph measures
The /distance/ between two vertices is the number of edges in the
shortest path between them. In a family tree, the distance between
parents and children is always 1 and the distance between grandparents
and grandchildren is 2 (Table 3).

The distance is the basis for a range of measures, starting with
/eccentricity:/ the greatest distance between a vertex and any other
vertex in a graph. Eccentricity is a good indication of the centrality
of a vertex in a graph. It is also an indication of the size of the
graph: the /radius/ of a graph is the smallest eccentricity of any
vertex in the graph and the /diameter /of a graph is the greatest
eccentricity of any vertex in the graph. The vertices with an
eccentricity equal to the radius form the /center /of the graph, while
the vertices with an eccentricity equal to the diameter form
the /periphery /(Table 4).

In the example of the metro map, these measures suggest that vertices D
and K are the center, and vertices A, G, H and N the periphery (Figure
6). In between the two are vertices with eccentricities of 5 and 6.
These groups agree with intuitive interpretations of the metro map. You
may also choose to form the center out of vertices with an eccentricity
of 4 and 5 or the periphery out of vertices with an eccentricity of 6
and 7. Using ranges of values also agrees with intuitive interpretations
and can be useful with large graphs.

 

#+caption: /Figure 6. The center and the periphery of the metro graph/
[[file:media/assets/metro_labelled_center_periphery.png]]

 

In addition to eccentricity, you can use the /closeness/ of a vertex:
its inverse mean distance to all other vertices in the graph, calculated
by dividing the number of all other vertices (the order of the graph
minus one) by the sum of distances to these vertices. The higher the
value of closeness, the more central the position of a vertex (Table 4).
In the example of the metro map, closeness and eccentricity agree that
vertices D and K are the most central. As for the rest of the vertices,
the closeness values offer more variation than eccentricity and thus a
more refined basis for grouping them.

* Directed graphs
Many relations are directed by their precedence in time, in relation to
movement or through another dependence, as in the relation between
parent and child. These can be represented in /directed graphs
(digraphs)/, where things are represented by /nodes /(a synonym of
vertex, which we will use to indicate that we are dealing with a
digraph) and relations by /arcs/ (i.e. directed edges). Due to
directedness, some things are slightly different from undirected graphs:

- A node has an /in-/ and an /out-degree,/ measured respectively by the
  number of incoming and out outgoing arcs. A node with an in-degree of
  0 is called a /source. /Source nodes are the starting points of
  processes. A node with an out-degree of 0 is called
  a /terminal /(or /sink/) and represents an endpoint in a process.
- A walk is directed: it consists of arcs with the same direction.
- A path is similarly directed (/dipath/): This obviously affects
  connectivity: a digraph is /strongly connected /if there is a dipath
  that connects every pair of nodes or /weakly connected /if the
  undirected underlying graph obtained by replacing all arcs with edges
  in connected.

Graphs that contain both edges and arcs are called /mixed /and are to be
avoided in the context of this book. In the subjects discussed here,
either the direction does not matter (as with most doors in a building)
or is strictly defined by time or dependence (as in the transition from
one task to another in a process). It may be tempting to add
bidirectional arcs to process diagrams but these, too, should be avoided
because they merely obfuscate the process, e.g. obscure feedback.

* Graph operations
The changes you apply to a graph include:

- /Edge contraction/: the replacement of an edge and two vertices
  incident to it with a single vertex
- /Edge subdivision:/ the replacement of an edge with a vertex and
  connection of the new vertex with new edges to the ends of the
  original vertices

- /Vertex identification:/ replacement of any two vertices with a single
  vertex incident to all edges previously incident to either of the
  original vertices
- /Vertex splitting:/ the replacement of a vertex with two adjacent
  vertices and of each edge incident to the original vertex with an edge
  incident to either new vertex (but not to both)

In all transformations of a graph, it is advisable to think in terms of
these operations to ensure consistency and avoid omissions, such as
forgetting to connect a new node to the existing ones when refining a
process diagram. They help connect the previous state of the graph to
the new one and to meaning of the changes you want to implement. In
particular, the transition from process to information diagram involves
changes that benefit from considering them as graph operations.

* Appendix II: Parameterization

* What is parameterization
To understand what parameterization is and how it works, let us consider
a simple, basic example: the equation that describes a straight line:

/y/ = /a·x/ + /b/

In this equation, /x/ and /y/ are the coordinates of each point on the
line, and /a/ and /b/ are parameters. The values of these parameters do
not change the line type: the equation always describes a straight line.
What /a/ and /b/ do is determine key properties of the line:

- /a /determines the slope of the line: if it is negative, the line goes
  down to the left; if it is positive, down to the right; if its is 1,
  the slope is 45 degrees; if it is zero, the line is horizontal
- /b /determines the /y/ intercept: the point where the line crosses
  the /y /axis

 

#+caption: /Figure 1. left to right: y/=/x/+/2; y/=/0x/+/2;y=/--/x/--/2/
[[file:media/assets/straight-lines.png]]

 

Instead of fixed values, the two parameters can be variable, so that we
can control them in a transparent and precise manner. Moving a line to a
new position without changing its slope, for instance, amounts to adding
a number to /b./ Parameter values can be constrained to take specific
values, e.g. if /a /can only be -1 or +1, the equation is allowed to
produce only line slopes of 45 degrees. They can also be constrained
relative to parameters of other lines. For example, this equation
describes lines that are always parallel to our original example:

/y_{1}/ = /a·x_{1}/ + (/b /+ /c) /

The following equation describes lines that are always perpendicular to
our example:

/y_{2}/ = (-1//a)·x_{2}/ + (/b /+ /d) /

Any change to the parameters of the original line also triggers changes
to the other two lines, so that they always remain respectively parallel
and perpendicular to it. Constraining one thing relative to another in
this way is the foundation of parameterization in design, for example,
keeping walls parallel or perpendicular to each other, keeping their
dimensions in the same proportions etc.

* Kinds of parameterization
There are three kinds of parameterization in design:

1. /Geometric:/ affecting the geometric properties of a symbol, e.g.
   length or slope
2. /Topological:/ concerning the number and configuration of symbols,
   e.g. the number and position of steps in a stair in relation to the
   height that has to be bridged
3. /Symbolic:/ concerning non-geometric properties of a symbol, e.g. the
   type of a wall one may enter in a model can be constrained by
   applicable fire safety regulations or acoustic requirements

The above line example is of the geometric kind. Figure 2 is an example
of the topological kind: a helical stair, consisting of geometrically
identical steps. Each step is positioned with the bottom line of its
riser fully aligned with the far end of the tread of the previous step.
In this way, there are no gaps between them and they form a steady
progression from a lower level to a higher.

 

#+caption: /Figure 2. Helical stair/
[[file:media/assets/stair_1.png]]

 

If the height difference between the two floors changes (Figure 3 and
4), more steps are added in the same fashion: topological
parameterization affects the number of required steps. The geometry of
the steps and their relation do not change, in contrast to the overall
form of the stair.

 

#+caption: /Figure 3. Helical stair lengthened/
[[file:media/assets/stair_2.png]]

 

#+caption: /Figure 4. Helical stair further lengthened/
[[file:media/assets/stair_3.png]]

 

One can also choose to modify the geometry of the steps when the height
difference between floors changes: keep the number of steps the same and
increase or decrease the rise of each step. In this case, which is
possible only with small height differences that do not destroy the
climbability of the stair, the parameterization is geometric.

Symbolic parameterization concerns non-geometric values, which can
nevertheless be fundamentally quantitative. For example, around a music
room in a school one needs to have walls and floors with a heavier
acoustic insulation than in other parts of the building, while the walls
and floors around a chemistry lab must have a higher fire resistance:
the use of the space imposes a threshold of acceptable acoustic or
fire-resistance performance. Each type of wall and floor in BIM can be
automatically evaluated against this threshold, resulting in automatic
warnings or even refusal when an inappropriate symbol is entered in the
model. The values that are compared in this example are numerical (the
threshold required by the space versus the relevant performance of the
wall) but the parametric relation is between space use type and wall or
floor type. Similarly, the colour design of a space can be based on a
monochromatic scheme with variations in lightness and saturation. If the
primary colour in the scheme changes, then all these variations are
adapted, resulting in different RAL or Pantone codes.

* Parameterization and semantic data types
One of the interesting effects of parameterization is on the semantic
type of symbol properties: it turns primary data into derivative. The
length of a wall is normally primary information because it is an
essential part of its identity. However, if a particular wall is
constrained to have the same length as another wall, then the length of
the former becomes derivative, as it follows any change to the length of
the latter. Removing the constraint makes the two walls independent of
each other and makes the length of both primary again.

This example illustrates the significance and complexity of
parameterization in design: on one hand, parameterization makes the
configuration and modification of a symbolic representation easier and
safer. Rather than having to adjust the dimensions of every wall
separately, we can relate them all to each other, establishing a
parametric network that supports the propagation of changes to one wall
to all others. Unfortunately, such a network is had to define because we
have to anticipate all possible changes to every wall and their
significance to others. Relating everything to a single wall and then
manipulating only than one is practically never the answer.

Moreover, each symbol in the representation may belong to multiple
networks. A wall, for example, can be related to geometric parametric
networks that affect its dimensions; to acoustic parametric networks
that constrain properties relevant to acoustics, such as mass and
rigidity, relative to the activities taking place on either side of the
wall; to fire safety parametric networks that constrain other material
properties relative to the location of the wall along egress routes or
fire compartment boundaries. Resolving conflicts between the effects of
different networks is a major problem in design parameterization and
information management.

The book presents a coherent theory of building information, focusing on
its representation and management in the digital era. It addresses
issues such as the information explosion and the structure of analogue
building representations to propose a parsimonious approach to the
deployment and utilization of symbolic digital technologies like BIM. It
also considers the matching representation of AECO processes in terms of
tasks, so as to connect to information processing and support both
information management and decision taking.

Alexander Koutamanis is associate professor of computational design at
the Faculty of Architecture & the Built Environment, Delft University of
Technology, the Netherlands. He has studied architecture at Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and received his PhD from Delft
University of Technology on the automated recognition of architectural
floor plans.
